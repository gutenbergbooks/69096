<p>
In a large bedroom, on an autumn afternoon,
two girls were divesting themselves
of their out-door attire after a walk.
They were dressed alike, though their
ages were eleven and nineteen.  Their costume
consisted of brown stuff petticoats, over which they
wore cashmere gowns of a white ground, covered
with brown-stemmed red flowers, and edged with
quillings of green ribbon.  These dresses were
high in the back and on the shoulders, but were
cut down square in the front.  The sleeves reached
to the elbows, and were there finished by white
muslin frills.  The girls wore high-heeled shoes,
the heels being red, and brown worsted stockings,
which the petticoat was short enough to show
plainly.  On the dressing-table before them lay
two tall white muslin caps, called <i>cornettes</i>, abundant
in frills and lace, but having no strings.  The
hair of both girls was dressed high over a frame,
standing up some three inches above their heads;
and when the elder put on her cap, it increased
her apparent height by at least three inches more.
</p>

<p>
The chamber in which they were dressing was
long and low, two large beams being visible in the
ceiling; and the casement, not two feet in height,
ran nearly across the width of the room.  There
was a faint, delicate scent of lavender.  The
furniture comprised a large four-post bedstead, an
unwieldy wardrobe, a washstand, a dressing-table,
and two chairs.  The carpet was only round the
bed and washstand, the rest of the floor being left
uncovered, and shining with age and use.  The
walls were wainscoted about half-way to the ceiling,
the higher portion being painted a dull
light-green.  The girls turned to leave the room.
</p>

<p>
"O Lucy! your <i>cornette</i>!"
</p>

<p>
Lucy&mdash;aged eleven&mdash;made a dash at the dressing-table,
and seizing her cap by its frills, to the
severe detriment of the lace, stuck it on her head
in the first way that occurred to her, and was about
to rush down-stairs without further ceremony.
</p>

<p>
"That will not do, Lucy," said the elder girl.
"You know what Henrietta will say.  Go to the
mirror and put your <i>cornette</i> on properly."
</p>

<p>
Muttering something which sounded like a
statement that she did not care what Henrietta
said, Lucy retraced her steps to the glass, pulled
off the <i>cornette</i>, and stuck it on again, in a style
very little better than before.  This done, she
joined her sister, who was half-way down the
stairs.  It was a fine old wooden staircase which
the girls descended, "worn by the feet that now
were silent,"[<a id="chap01fn1text"></a><a href="#chap01fn1">1</a>] and at its base a long, narrow
passage stretched right and left.  Our young friends
turned to the right, and after passing on for a few
feet, entered a door on the left hand, which led to
the family parlor.  This room had already three
occupants, two young ladies and a boy of fourteen.
The two former were dressed like Lucy and her
sister, except that the younger of them, who sat at
a tapestry-frame in the corner of the room, wore
broad pieces of brown velvet round her neck and
wrists.  The boy, who was equipped in out-door
costume, part of which consisted of a pair of thick
and pre-eminently splashed boots, sat on a low
chair, staring into the fire, whistling, and playing
with a riding-whip.
</p>

<p>
"Lucy! your hair!" was the shocked exclamation
with which the new-comers were received.
</p>

<p>
"Oh, my hair is all right!  I brushed it&mdash;this
morning," said Lucy, the last words in a much
lower tone than the rest; and then she asked of
her whistling brother, "Have you heard anything,
Charley?"
</p>

<p>
Charley shook his head without ceasing to
whistle.
</p>

<p>
"Harry is not come yet?"
</p>

<p>
"No," said Charley, in a very discontented tone;
"and he has taken Bay Fairy, and I can't go out.
'Tis enough to provoke a saint."
</p>

<p>
"That ben't you, Master Charley!" said a new
and cheery voice, as an elderly woman appeared,
carrying a little tea-tray, from behind the heavy,
japanned screen which stood near the door.  She
was dressed in a black woollen gown, low in the
neck, with a white muslin kerchief above, and a
cap of more modest pretensions than those of the
young ladies.
</p>

<p>
"What does the impertinent old woman mean
by calling me a sinner?" inquired Charley,
addressing himself to his boots.
</p>

<p>
"You ben't?" said old Cicely, setting down the
tea-tray.  "Well! stand up and let us look at you,
do!  You are the first ever I see that wasn't no
sinner!"
</p>

<p>
To which cutting observation Charley replied
only by banging the door between himself and the
unwelcome querist.
</p>

<p>
"Ay, it ben't for none of us to set ourselves up
i' thatn's!" meditatively remarked old Cicely, in
her turn to the teapot.  "Mrs. Henrietta, there's a
poor old man at the yard-door, my dear, and I
can't tell where to look for Madam; maybe you'd
see to him, poor soul?"
</p>

<p>
Henrietta, the eldest sister, answered by quitting
the room.  Cicely arranged the tea-cups&mdash;large
shallow cups of delicate china&mdash;on a small round
table in the window.
</p>

<p>
"The tea is ready, Mrs. Bell," she said; "will
you please to pour it?"
</p>

<p>
The decorated young lady who sat at the
tapestry-frame rose languidly, and began to pour out
the tea, while Cicely set four chairs round the
little table; having done which, the latter calmly
took one of them herself, and producing a large
colored handkerchief from her pocket, carefully
spread it over her black woollen dress.
</p>

<p>
"Well, truly," said she, for she was in a talkative
mood this evening, "there is no end to the good in
a dish of tea.  I am sorry I ever said what I have
done against it, my dears, and I wish Madam
would drink it.  'Tis so heartening like!  It is a
new-fangled sort of drink, there's no denying; but
surely, I wonder how we ever got on without it!"
</p>

<p>
"Cicely," said Henrietta, coming in, "I have
told Dolly to give the poor man some meat and
dry straw in the shed for to-night."
</p>

<p>
"Very good, Mrs. Henrietta," answered Cicely;
"I'll see as he gets it.  Mrs. Bell, I'll be obliged
to you of another dish of tea."
</p>

<p>
There were only four tea-drinkers in this family,
and, until a few months previous, there had been
only three.  The gentlemen despised what they
considered a washy and exclusively feminine
beverage, and the mistress of the house could by no
means be induced to taste it.  It was a new-fangled
drink, she said, and new-fangled things, of
whatever description, she abhorred.  People never
drank tea when she was a child, and why should
they want it now?  This was Madam Passmore's
logic, and under its influence she drank no tea.
Still she did not forbid her daughters' indulging in
it.  Young people, she allowed, were given to
new-fangled things; and could be expected to be wiser
only as they grew older.  She was a little annoyed
when the logic of the young people, adverse to her
own, made a tea-convert of Cicely Aggett, who was
about twenty-five years her senior; but Madam
Passmore was a quiet, passive sort of woman, who
never kept anger long, and was in her heart a
fatalist.  "What must be must be," she used to
say; and many a time had she consoled herself
with this comforting adage under troubles of
various kinds.  She said so when her son Harry
went into the army; she said so when her husband
broke his leg in fox-hunting; and she said so, but
with tears, when her little daughter Margaret died.
She had no political opinions but those of her
husband, who was a fervent Whig; but deep down in
her heart she was a profound Tory in all domestic
matters, for she disliked change and novelty
beyond everything.  She never put down a new
carpet until the old carpet was quite beyond
endurance; not from any parsimonious motive, but
simply because she liked best those things to
which she was most accustomed.  She never would
have slept with comfort if her bed had been turned
with its side to the wall instead of its back; nor
would she ever have conceded that a new lamp
burnt half so brightly as the old one.  Her surviving
family consisted of two sons and four daughters,
who were remarkably alike in person&mdash;all but
one.  The neighbors who were sufficiently high in
position to visit with Squire Passmore of Ashcliffe,
often wondered how it was that Celia Passmore
was so unlike every other member of the family.
They were tall and stately in figure, she was small
and slight; they had abundant light hair, hers was
thin and dark; their eyes were blue or gray, hers
brown.  Most of all was she unlike her twin-sister,
Isabella, who was considered the beauty of the
family, and was very well aware of it.  There was
nothing remarkable about any of the others; but
Celia, some said, was sadly plain, poor girl! and it
must be a great mortification to Madam Passmore,
who had been a country belle in her young days.
</p>

<p>
Cicely Aggett, whom we have seen seated at the
table with her young mistresses, was one of a class
wholly extinct in our days.  She was a dependent,
but not a servant.  She had, some fifty years
before this, been Madam Passmore's nurse, and
she now filled a nondescript position in the family
of her nursling.  She was always ready to help or
advise, and considered nothing beneath her which
could add to the comfort of any member of the
family; but she took all her meals in the parlor,
and was essentially one of themselves.  She was
the confidante of everybody, and all knew that she
never abused a trust.  Madam Passmore would as
soon have thought of turning the dog out of the
room before making a confidential communication,
as of turning out Cicely, simply because Cicely's
dog-like fidelity was completely above suspicion.
</p>

<p>
The tea was now finished.  Lucy, who had not
yet arrived at the dignity of a tea-drinker, was
roaming about the room as Cicely departed with
the tea-tray.
</p>

<p>
"There is Harry!" she exclaimed, looking out
of the window.  "He must have some news&mdash;he is
waving something above his head.  Henrietta,
may I run and meet him?"
</p>

<p>
Henrietta gave consent, and away went Lucy at
the top of her speed down the broad avenue which
led from the house through the park.  The young
officer was trotting up on Bay Fairy, with his
spaniel Pero panting after him; but he reined in
his horse as Lucy came up to him.
</p>

<p>
"A victory!" he cried.  "A victory at Malplaquet! a
glorious victory!  Run, Lucy!&mdash;a race! who
will tell Father first?"
</p>

<p>
Lucy&mdash;if it were possible; there was very little
doubt of that.  She ran back as fast as she had
come, turning her head once to see how Harry was
getting on.  He was not urging his horse beyond
a walk; it was evident that he meant to give her a
chance of winning.  She ran towards the stable-yard,
where she knew that the Squire was, and at
last, arriving triumphantly first at the yard-gate,
burst suddenly into the arms of her father, as he
was just opening the gate to come out.
</p>

<p>
"Hallo!" said the Squire, when this unexpected
apparition presented itself.  "Hoity-toity!  What
is the matter, Lucibelle?"
</p>

<p>
"A&mdash;victory!" was all that Lucy could utter.
</p>

<p>
"Where? who told you?" he asked, excitedly.
</p>

<p>
"Harry," said the panting Lucy.  "Somewhere
in&mdash;France, I think&mdash;'tis a&mdash;queer name."
</p>

<p>
"In France, Sir, at Malplaquet," said Harry,
who now rode up quickly, having good-naturedly
allowed his little sister the pleasure of winning the
race; "a great victory under the Duke of
Marlborough."  And he handed the <i>Gazette</i> to his father.
</p>

<p>
"That is glorious!" said the Squire.  "I will go
in and tell Mother."
</p>

<p>
Not that Mother&mdash;that is, Madam Passmore&mdash;cared
anything about victories, but she liked to
see her husband pleased, and would have welcomed
equally a victory or a defeat which had wrought
that desirable end.  Harry walked into the house
with his father, and Lucy, having regained her
breath, followed them.
</p>

<p>
"Why, Charley, where have you been?" asked
the Squire, as that young gentleman made his
appearance.  "Here is a splendid victory over the
French, and you are not here to cheer!"
</p>

<p>
"Where have I been?" repeated Charley, in a
very glum tone.  "Well, I like that!  I have been
at home, Sir, kicking my heels together for want of
anything else to do: your party and Harry had
taken all the horses."
</p>

<p>
"I did not know you wanted Fairy, Charley,"
said Harry, kindly.  "I am sorry I took her."
</p>

<p>
"Come, my lad, no use in crying over spilt
milk," said the Squire.  "It is Saturday night,
Charley, and people ought to be at peace on
Saturday night."
</p>

<p>
"I hate Saturday nights, and Sundays too, and
I don't want to be at peace!" said Charley,
walking off.
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
On that afternoon, while Harry was riding home
with the news of the victory of Malplaquet, an
event was taking place in London Which the family
at Ashcliffe little imagined, yet which very nearly
concerned one of them.
</p>

<p>
In an upper room of a house in Holborn Bars
sat half a dozen men in conclave.  The door of
the chamber was double, the inner of green baize,
the outer of strong oak, barred and bolted, as if
the conference were desirous to avoid eavesdroppers.
</p>

<p>
At one side of the table sat three men, all of
whom had passed middle age.  We have little to
do with them, so they may be succinctly described
as two short men and one tall one.  Opposite
stood three others, who were all young; and it is
with one of these alone that we are intimately concerned.
</p>

<p>
He was about twenty-six years of age, tall and
slight; he wore a black wig, and his eyes, also
black, were peculiarly brilliant and penetrating.
Yet his complexion was moderately fair, and he
was not devoid of a fresh, healthy color.  There
was great quickness, combined with some natural
grace, in all his motions; and he evidently
comprehended the meaning of his elder and slower
companions before their sentences were above
half-finished.
</p>

<p>
"Here, Brother Cuthbert, are your instructions,"
the tall man was saying.  "You remember, I am
sure, the private orders which I gave you a week
past, with reference to certain information to be
gained and brought to the King?"
</p>

<p>
"Perfectly, Father&mdash;all of them," replied Cuthbert,
in a clear, pleasant voice.
</p>

<p>
"Very well.  Now listen to another order.  My
Lady Ingram writ to the General a month past, to
send on an errand for her&mdash;(if it might be done
with any other we should have)&mdash;one of our number,
who could be trusted for secrecy, speed,
diligence, and discretion.  We have named you."
</p>

<p>
Brother Cuthbert bowed low in answer.
</p>

<p>
"This matter of her Ladyship's," pursued the
tall man, "is, of course, of secondary importance,
and may not, indeed, directly conduce to the
interests of the Church.  It must, nevertheless, be
borne in mind, that should the sons die unmarried
(as it is desirable the elder should), the daughter
will become heir to the Ingram estates.  I
mentioned something of this to you last night."
</p>

<p>
Brother Cuthbert bowed again.
</p>

<p>
"Moreover, for other reasons known to the General,
it was thought desirable to grant her Ladyship's
request.  Your destination, in the first
place, is Exeter, where you will be met by my
Lady Ingram's gentleman-usher, Mr. Gilbert Irvine,
who is able to give you any information concerning
her affairs which you may find it necessary to
ask.  From Exeter, you will proceed (after doing
your business there) to Ashcliffe Hall, an old
mansion on the road to Moreton Hampstead, belonging
to one John Passmore, a Whig country gentleman.
Here is a sealed paper, which you will open
at Exeter.  It contains further instructions, a plan
of Ashcliffe Hall, and various notes which you
may find useful.  And here are ten guineas, which
my Lady Ingram has transmitted.  Mr. Irvine will
accompany you to Ashcliffe; and you can employ
or dismiss him at that place, as circumstances may
arise.  In the mean time, we recommend to you
not on any consideration to neglect either the
general and constant necessity of serving the
Church, as the opportunity may present itself,
nor the special secret service on which you go,
touching the King and cause.  If you require
more money, apply to any one of us three.  We
rely upon you, not, on the one hand, to be more
lavish of either time or money than is necessary,
nor, on the other, to leave the work only half-finished."
</p>

<p>
"I will do my utmost, Father, to order myself
by your instructions," replied Cuthbert, lifting his
head.
</p>

<p>
"You will supply yourself with a surname, which
even Mr. Irvine must not know not to be your
real name.  Select one which shall not be so
uncommon as to attract notice, nor so common that
letters would be likely to miscarry.  You can
consider this at your leisure, and let us know
to-morrow of what name you have thought, since we
shall not require you to set out before to-morrow
evening."
</p>

<p>
"What say you to 'Stevens?'" suggested Cuthbert
in a moment.
</p>

<p>
A grave consultation among the elder Jesuits
followed, ending with the approval of Cuthbert's
suggestion.
</p>

<p>
"You are very young, my Brother, to be trusted
with so grave and important a matter as His
Majesty's errands are," warned the elder priest in
conclusion.  "We have relied upon your ingenuity
and devotion.  Let us not have cause to regret
choosing you."
</p>

<p>
"You will not do that, Father," answered
Cuthbert, not so much proudly as coolly and confidently.
</p>

<p>
And making his adieux to the conclave, Mr. Cuthbert
Stevens&mdash;for so we must henceforth call
him&mdash;withdrew from the room.
</p>

<p>
We shall see him again shortly; but for the
present we must return (rather more rapidly than
he could travel) to Ashcliffe Hall.
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
"Celia!" said Lucy to her sister, a few hours
later, as the latter tucked her up in bed, "do you
think&mdash;is it very&mdash;did you hear what Charley said
about Sunday?"
</p>

<p>
"Yes, dear.  Charley was in a passion, and did
not mean what he said, I hope."
</p>

<p>
"But do you think that it is&mdash;very wicked&mdash;to
get so tired on Sunday?" asked Lucy, slowly, as
if she were half afraid of bringing her thoughts to
light.  "For I do get dreadfully tired, Celia.
Sermons, endless sermons all day long! for, as if
the sermon in church were not enough, Father
must needs read another at home on Sunday
nights!  Celia, do you think it is very wrong to
get tired of sermons?"
</p>

<p>
"I suppose," said Celia, thoughtfully, "that
must depend on the sort of sermon."
</p>

<p>
"I never seem to get a chance of hearing any
sort but one," said Lucy; "and I can't understand
them."
</p>

<p>
"Well, Lucy, it is not pleasant to be obliged to
sit still and listen to what you do not understand,"
Celia admitted.
</p>

<p>
"Oh, I get so tired!" said Lucy, flinging herself
on another part of the bed, as if the very thought
of the coming Sunday fatigued her.  "Don't take
the light away just yet, Celia."
</p>

<p>
"No, dear; I have my clean ruffles to sew on
for to-morrow," answered Celia, sitting down to
her work.
</p>

<p>
"Celia, do you understand Dr. Braithwaite's
sermons?"
</p>

<p>
"Not always.  Remember what a learned man
he is, Lucy; we must not expect very wise men to
talk like you and me."
</p>

<p>
"I wish he did not know quite so much, then,"
said Lucy.  "I could understand him if he would
talk like you."
</p>

<p>
"Aught I can do for you, Mrs. Celia, my dear?"
asked old Cicely, looking in.  "Prithee give me
those ruffles.  You have been sewing all day."
</p>

<p>
"Cicely," asked Lucy, returning to the charge,
"do you understand Dr. Braithwaite's sermons?"
</p>

<p>
"No, my dear, scarce a word," said Cicely.
</p>

<p>
"I wonder at your listening so quietly!"
</p>

<p>
"Well, you see, my dear, I has my thoughts,"
said Cicely, fitting the ruffle.  "If aught goes on
that I can't understand, why, I has my thoughts.
When Master reads a sermon of an evening, well,
sometimes I understand, and sometimes not.  If I
do, well and good; but if I don't, I can sit and
think.  And I think, Miss Lucy, that there's a deal
of difference between you and me; but there's a
cruel deal bigger difference between either of us
and Him up yonder.  It must be a sight harder
for us to understand Him than it is to understand
Parson Braithwaite."
</p>

<p>
"But what has that to do with it, Cicely?" asked
Lucy, wonderingly.
</p>

<p>
"Why, my dear, ben't that what all sermons is
for&mdash;to teach us to understand God?  Just the
beginning, you know, must be hard; it always is.
Why, when Madam had me learned to read&mdash;old
Madam, your grandmother, my dears&mdash;do you
think I liked learning the Christ-Cross-Row?[<a id="chap01fn2text"></a><a href="#chap01fn2">2</a>]
Wasn't it very hard, think you, keeping day after
day a-saying, 'A, B, C, D,' when there wasn't no
sense in it?  But 'tis all through the
Christ-Cross-Row that I've learned to read the Book.
Eh! but I have thanked old Madam many a
hundred times for having me learned to read the
Book!  Well, my dears, 'tis always hard at the
beginning; and sure the beginning of learning
Him must be harder nor learning to read."
</p>

<p>
"Why, Cicely, you are as bad to understand as
Dr. Braithwaite!"
</p>

<p>
"Maybe so, my dear.  If a little one asked you
for to tell him what big A was like, I think you'd
scarce make him understand without showing him.
And if you want to know what He is like, I think
you must read the Book.  'Tis like a picture of
Him.  I don't know any other way, without you
read the Book."
</p>

<p>
"Do you mean the Bible, Cicely?  But
Dr. Braithwaite does not say much about that."
</p>

<p>
"I haven't got nought to say about Parson
Braithwaite, Miss Lucy.  But surely all that is
good in any sermon or aught else must come out
of the Book."
</p>

<p>
"But we could read that at home."
</p>

<p>
"So we could, my dear; more's the pity as we
don't!  But there's somewhat in the Book about
that&mdash;as we ben't to stop going to church."[<a id="chap01fn3text"></a><a href="#chap01fn3">3</a>]
</p>

<p>
"Where is that, Cicely?  I never saw it."
</p>

<p>
"I haven't a good memory, not for particular
words, my dear, and I can't tell you without I had
the Book; but 'tis there, certain sure."
</p>

<p>
Celia had been quietly looking in her little
book-case while Cicely was speaking.  It contained
many things beside books&mdash;baskets, pincushions,
bottles of Hungary and lavender water, and other
heterogeneous articles.  But there were about
half a dozen books absolutely her own, and one of
them was a Bible&mdash;a Bible which she very rarely
opened, she acknowledged to herself, with a feeling
of shame.  Looking for it, and bringing it out,
she secretly wiped the dust from the covers, and
offered it to Cicely.
</p>

<p>
"Here is one, Cicely; can you show us what
you mean?"
</p>

<p>
"Not in your Book, Mrs. Celia.  If I had my
own Book, I could.  My dear, 'tis choke-full of
marks&mdash;bits of worsted mostly.  I often have it
lying open by me when I'm a-darning stockings or
some such work, and if I finds a particular nice
bit, why, down there goes a bit of worsted into
him.  Eh! but I have some fine bits marked with
them worsted!  My dears, if you haven't read the
Book you don't know what nice reading there is."
</p>

<p>
"I think I will read it," said Lucy, gaping.
</p>

<p>
"You can't without you have glasses, my dear,"
said Cicely, quietly, finishing off the ruffle.
</p>

<p>
"Glasses!  Why Cicely!" exclaimed Lucy.
</p>

<p>
"Yes, Miss Lucy, glasses," was Cicely's persistent
answer.  "Not such like as I works with, my
dear: them is earthly glasses.  But there is
heavenly glasses, and you can't rend the Book
without, and you must ask Him for them.  He is
sure to give them if you ask Him.  I think I could
find that bit, Mrs. Celia, if you will give me bold."
</p>

<p>
Celia passed the Bible to the old woman, and
she, opening at the first chapter of St. Matthew,
slowly traced the lines until she reached the
passage which she wanted.
</p>

<p>
"Now, look here, Mrs. Celia.  This is him."
</p>

<p>
Celia took the book, and read where Cicely
pointed.
</p>

<p>
"'If ye, then, being evil, know how to give
good gifts unto your children, how much more
shall your Father which is in heaven give good
things to them that ask Him?'"[<a id="chap01fn4text"></a><a href="#chap01fn4">4</a>]
</p>

<p>
"Stop a bit!" said old Cicely; "that ben't just
the one I meant.  Let's look a bit on."
</p>

<p>
After a little more searching she discovered her
text.  "Read that, please, Mrs. Celia," she said.
</p>

<p>
Celia read in a low tone: "'If ye, then, being evil,
know how to give good gifts unto your children:
how much more shall your heavenly Father give
the Holy Spirit to them that ask Him?'"[<a id="chap01fn5text"></a><a href="#chap01fn5">5</a>]
</p>

<p>
Lucy seemed to have dropped asleep.
</p>

<p>
"Cicely," asked Celia, "how shall we know if we
have the Holy Spirit?"
</p>

<p>
"Feel Him, my dear,&mdash;feel Him!" said Cicely,
with a light in her eyes.  "I reckon you don't want
telling whether you are happy or not, do you?"
</p>

<p>
"No, indeed," replied Celia, smiling.
</p>

<p>
"No more you'll want to be told whether you
have Him," resumed old Cicely, triumphantly.
</p>

<p>
"But how did you get Him given?" pursued
Celia.
</p>

<p>
"Why, my dear, I wanted Him, and I asked for
Him, and I got Him.  'Tis just so simple as that.
I never knew aught about it till I read the Book.
I'm only a very simple, ignorant, old woman, my
dear.  Maybe the reason why I don't know no
more is just that I am such a dunce.  He can't
learn me no more, because I haven't no wits to be
learned.  You've got plenty of wit, Mrs. Celia&mdash;you
try!  Why, just think the lots of things you
know more than me!  You can write, and make
figures, and play pretty music, and such like, and I
know nought but sewing, and dressing meat and
drink, and reading the Book.  Mayhap the Lord
gives me fine things to think about, just because I
know so little of other things&mdash;a sort of making up
like, you see.  But you try it, Mrs. Celia, my
dear!"
</p>

<p>
"I fear I scarce have your glasses, Cicely,"
answered Celia, with a sigh.
</p>

<p>
"I've done the ruffles now," said Cicely, rising.
"You come to me into my little room when you've
time, Mrs. Celia, and I'll show you some of them
fine bits&mdash;any time you like.  And as to the
glasses, you ask for 'em.  Good-night, Mrs. Celia."
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
Ashcliffe Hall was up at six on week-days, but
when the Sunday came round, it was not its
custom to rise before eight.  Costumes were resplendent
on that day, and took some time in assuming.
On Sundays and special gala-days only, the young
ladies wore hoop-petticoats and patched their
faces.[<a id="chap01fn6text"></a><a href="#chap01fn6">6</a>]  Their attire to-day comprised quilted
petticoats of light-blue satin, silk brocaded gowns,
extremely long in the waist, <i>cornettes</i> of lace,
lace-trimmed muslin aprons, white silk stockings, and
shoes with silver buckles.  Their gowns, too, had
trains, which for comfort were fastened up behind,
looking like a huge burden on the back of the
wearer.  They looked very stiff as they rustled
down the stairs,&mdash;all except Lucy, whom no costume
on earth could stiffen, though even she wore
a graver and more demure air than usual, which
perhaps was partly due to the coming sermons.
The girls drank their tea, Lucy joining them in the
meal, but using milk instead of the fashionable
beverage.  By the time they had done, Madam
Passmore and the Squire were down-stairs; they
always breakfasted in their own room on Sunday
mornings.  Then John, the old coachman, slowly
drove up to the front door the great family-coach,
drawn by two large, dappled, long-maned and
heavy-looking horses.  The coach held eight
inside, so that it conveniently accommodated all the
family, Cicely included, with the exception of
Charley, who generally perched himself on the great
box, which was quite large enough to admit him
between John and the footman.  The church was
barely half a mile from the Hall, but none of the
Ashcliffe family ever thought of walking there;
such a proceeding would have involved a loss of
dignity.  It was a fine old Gothic edifice, one of
those large stately churches which here and there
seem dropped by accident into a country village,
whose population has dwindled far below its
ancient standard.  The pews were about five feet
high, the church having been recently and fashionably
repewed.  There was a great pulpit, with a
carved oak sounding-board, an equally large
reading-desk, and a clerk's desk, the last occupied by a
little old man who looked coeval with the church.
The Squire bestowed great attention upon the
responses, which he uttered in a loud, sonorous tone;
but when the psalm was over&mdash;one of Sternhold
and Hopkins' version, for Ashcliffe Church was
much too old and respectable to descend to the
new version of Tate and Brady&mdash;and when the
clergyman had announced his text, which the
Squire noted down, that in the evening he might
be able to question Charley and Lucy concerning
it&mdash;no further notice did anything obtain from the
owner of Ashcliffe Hall.  Settling himself into a
comfortable attitude, he laid his head back, and in
a few minutes was snoring audibly.  Madam Passmore
generally made efforts, more or less violent,
to remain awake, for about a quarter of an hour;
and then, succumbing to the inevitable, followed
her husband's example.  Henrietta kept awake and
immovable; so did Harry; but Isabella generally
slept for above half the sermon, and Lucy would
have followed her example had she dared, the fear
of her eldest sister just opposite her keeping her
decorous.  The discourse was certainly not
calculated to arouse a somnolent ear.  Dr. Braithwaite
generally began his sermon in some such style as
this:&mdash;"That most learned doctor of the schools,
styled by them of his age the Angelical Doctor,[<a id="chap01fn7text"></a><a href="#chap01fn7">7</a>]
whose words were as honey, yea, were full of
sweetness and delight unto the ears of such as
followed him, did in that greatest and most mellifluent
of the writings wherewith he regaled his study, did,
I say, observe, for the edification of the whole
Church, and the great profit of them that should
come after"&mdash;and then came a shower-bath of
Latin dashing down upon the unlearned ears of his
congregation.  Greek he rarely quoted, since there
was no one in the parish who understood it but
himself; so that it was but seldom that he
impressed the farmers with a due sense of the
heights and depths of his learning by uttering a
few words of that classic tongue; and whether his
quotation were from Pindar or St. Paul, made no
difference to them.
</p>

<p>
Until her conversation with Lucy and old
Cicely on the previous evening, Celia had been in
the habit of considering the sermon as something
with which she had nothing to do, except to sit it
out with patience and decorum.  She was beginning
to think differently now, and she tried hard
to follow Dr. Braithwaite this morning through his
discourse of an hour and three-quarters.  But the
sentences were long, the style involved, and the
worthy Doctor had got hold of a very unpromising
subject.  He was preaching upon the ceremony of
baptism in the primitive Church, and its relation
to the heresy of the Manichæans; and after half
an hour, during which she felt confused amid a
throng of exorcisms, white robes, catechumens,
deacons, immersions, fire-worshippers, Arians,
Pelagians, and Gnostics, Celia gave up her hopeless
task.  Old Cicely sat quite still, her eyes fixed on
the closed prayer-book on her knee, a soft,
pleased smile every now and then flitting across
her countenance; and Celia longed to know of
what she was thinking, which appeared to be so
much more interesting than Dr. Braithwaite's
Manichæans.
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
In a cheery, sunny little room, on the afternoon
of the same Sunday, sat old Cicely, with her
Bible on her lap.  There were several unoccupied
rooms in Ashcliffe Hall, and Cicely had chosen
this as hers, where the evening sun came lovingly
in, and dwelt for a season with lingering beams
on walls and furniture.  The same pleased smile
rested on the old woman's lips, as she slowly
traced the words with her finger along the page,
for Cicely read with little fluency; and she said
half aloud, though she was alone,&mdash;"'He hath
made Him to be sin for us, who knew no sin; that
we might be made the righteousness of God in
Him.'[<a id="chap01fn8text"></a><a href="#chap01fn8">8</a>]  Ben't that good, now?"
</p>

<p>
"May I come in, Cicely?" asked a soft voice at
the door.
</p>

<p>
"Surely, my dear, surely," was the answer.
"I'm just a-looking over some of them fine bits
where I has my marks.  I'll set a chair,
Mrs. Celia."
</p>

<p>
But the chair was set already, and Celia sat
down by the old woman.
</p>

<p>
"Now show me what you like best," she said.
</p>

<p>
"Well, my dear, I do read most of these here
four.  'Tis all good, you know&mdash;the very best of
reading, of course; but I can understand these here
best&mdash;Matthew, Mark, Luke, and John.  There's
nice reading in Luke&mdash;very pretty reading indeed;
but the beautifullest of 'em all, my dear, that's
John.  He is up-and-down like, is John.  You see
I can't get used to the Book like as you would.
There's five bits of John&mdash;two long uns and two
little uns, and one middling.  Now the last of 'em
I don't understand; 'tis main hard, only a bit here
and there; but when I do come to a bit that I can
understand, 'tis fine, to be sure!  But 'tis this
piece of him after Luke that I reads mostly, and
the next piece of him after that.  Look!"
</p>

<p>
It was an old, worn book, bound in plain brown
calf, which lay on Cicely's lap.  The pages were
encumbered with an infinitude of ends of
worsted,&mdash;black, brown, and gray.  These were Cicely's
guide-posts.  She was slowly pursuing the lines
with her finger, till she came upon the passage
which she wished to find.
</p>

<p>
"Now, my dear, you read that."
</p>

<p>
Celia read, "'And this is the promise which He
hath promised us, even eternal life.'"[<a id="chap01fn9text"></a><a href="#chap01fn9">9</a>]
</p>

<p>
"Wait a bit!" cried old Cicely; "there's
another in this big piece&mdash;a rare good un.  Let me
find him!"
</p>

<p>
And turning hastily over the leaves of her book,
she picked out, by the help of the worsteds, the
verse she wished.
</p>

<p>
"Read that, Mrs. Celia."
</p>

<p>
"'And this is life eternal, that they should know
Thee, the only true God, and Jesus Christ whom
Thou hast sent.'"[<a id="chap01fn10text"></a><a href="#chap01fn10">10</a>]
</p>

<p>
"Ben't that nice?" delightedly asked old Cicely.
</p>

<p>
"But how are we to know Him?" said Celia,
wearily.  "O Cicely!  I wanted to ask you of what
you were thinking this morning in the sermon
which pleased you so mightily.  You smiled as if
you were so happy."
</p>

<p>
"Did I, my dear?" answered old Cicely, smiling
again.  "Well, I dare say I did.  And I was cruel
happy, that's sure!  'Twas just these two verses,
Mrs. Celia, as I've been a-showing you.  I'd read
'em last thing yesterday, and surely they did feel
just like honey on my tongue.  So, as I couldn't
nohow make out what Parson Braithwaite were
a-saying about them many keys, I falls back, you
see, on my two verses.  Well, thinks I, if He has
promised us, sure we need not be afeard of losing
none of it.  If you promise somebody somewhat,
my dear, mayhap afore you come to do it you'll
feel sorry as you've promised, and be thinking of
harking back, as Jack says; but there is no
harking back with Him.  I think, afore He promises,
He looks of all sides, and you know, if he sees
everything, no wonder He promises so sure.  Well,
then, I thinks again, what has He promised us?
Eternal life.  Why, that's another bolt, like, put
on the door.  If 'tis eternal life, surely we can't
never let it go no more."
</p>

<p>
"But, Cicely," interrupted Celia, "don't you feel
that you are often doing wrong?"
</p>

<p>
"Of course I am so, my dear!" said Cicely.
"Every day in the year&mdash;ay, and every minute in
the day.  But then, you see, I just go to the
Book.  Look what I was a-reading when you
came in."
</p>

<p>
She pointed to the verse which had engaged
her.  "For He hath made Him to be sin for us,
who knew no sin; that we should be made the
righteousness of God in Him."
</p>

<p>
"Look there, Mrs. Celia!  Here's One that did
no sin, and yet bare the punishment that our sin
must needs have.  And if He bare the punishment
that did no sin, then belike we must go free
for whom He bare it.  Don't you see?  'Tis just
a matter of fair dealing.  The law can't punish
both&mdash;him as did the wrong and him as didn't.
So the other must go free."
</p>

<p>
"But we must do something to please God,
Cicely?  We must have something to bring to
Him?  It cannot be that Jesus Christ hath done
all for us, and we have but to take to ourselves
what He hath done, and to live as we list!"
</p>

<p>
"Well, my dear," said Cicely, "I've got my
thoughts upon that, too.  You look here!  I don't
find as ever I did a thing to please God afore I
took Him that died to stand for me.  I never cared
aught about pleasing Him; and do you think
He'd be like to be pleased with such work as that?
If He can see into our hearts, why, it must be just
like talking.  And do you think Madam would be
pleased with me, however well I sewed and swept,
if I just went saying forever, ''Tis not to please
you I'm working; I don't care a bit about you?'
</p>

<p>
"I think I do want to please Him," said Celia
slowly.
</p>

<p>
"Don't you stick at thinking, child," said old
Cicely, with a pleased look; "go on to knowing,
my dear.  Well, then, as to bringing something to
Him, look here in this other part."
</p>

<p>
Cicely turned to Isaiah, and after a little search,
pointed out a verse which Celia read.
</p>

<p>
"'But we are all as an unclean thing, and all
our righteousnesses are as filthy rags; and we all
do fade as a leaf; and our iniquities, like the wind,
have taken us away.'"[<a id="chap01fn11text"></a><a href="#chap01fn11">11</a>]
</p>

<p>
"If the Queen was a-coming this way, my dear,
and we was all of us a-going out to see her, what
would you think of me if you see me ransacking
the house for all the foul clothes I could find, to
tie up in a bundle, and saying, 'There!  I'm
a-going to give these to the Queen!'  Wouldn't you
think I was only fit for Bedlam?  You see it don't
say 'all our <i>iniquities</i> are as filthy rags;' we should
be ready to own that.  Dear, no! 'tis all our
<i>righteousnesses</i>.  Will you tell me, then, what we
have to bring to Him that is above all Kings and
Lords?  Well, and last of all, as to living as we
list.  I do find that mostly when we have made it
up like with Him, we list to live after His ways.
Not always&mdash;surely not always!" she added, sadly
shaking her head; "truly we are a pack of
good-for-noughts, e'en the best of us; yet it do hurt to
think as we've grieved Him when we come to see
all He has done and will do for us.  Them's my
thoughts upon that, Mrs. Celia."
</p>

<p>
"Why did you never speak to me&mdash;to any of
us&mdash;in this way before now, Cicely?" asked Celia,
very thoughtfully and gravely.
</p>

<p>
"Truly, my dear, I take shame to myself that I
never did," replied Cicely; "but you see there was
two reasons.  Firstly, 'tisn't so very long since I
come to know it myself&mdash;leastwise not many years.
Then, you see, when I did know, I hadn't the face,
like, for a good while.  Seemed so bold and
brassy like for me to be a-talking i' thatn's to the
likes of you, as knowed so much more than me.
And somehow it never seemed to come natural till
last night, and then it come all at once out of what
Miss Lucy she said about Parson's sermons."
</p>

<p>
Celia remained silent for a minute.  The mention
of Dr. Braithwaite's sermons had opened up a vein
of thought.  She wondered if anywhere there were
men who preached sermons of a different kind
from his, such as she and even old Cicely might
understand, and from which they could derive
benefit.  Was there any preacher who, instead of
enlarging on the Angelical Doctor, was satisfied to
keep to Jesus Christ and Him crucified?  A wild
desire sprang up in her heart to go to London,
and hear the great men who preached before the
Queen.  She did not mention this to Cicely.
Celia knew full well that it would appear to her
not only preposterous, but absolutely perilous.
Harry was the only member of the family who had
ever visited the metropolis, and this by virtue of
Her Majesty's commission.  The Squire considered
it a hot-bed of all evil, physical, moral, and
political.  Had he walked down the Strand, he
would honestly have suspected every man he met
to be a Jesuit in disguise, or at the least a
Jacobite, which he thought scarcely better.  He
believed that the air of the capital was close and
pestilential, that all honesty and morality were
banished from its borders, that all the men in
it&mdash;with the exception of the Duke of Marlborough
and the Whig Ministers&mdash;were arrant rogues, and
all the women&mdash;excluding the Queen and the
Duchess of Marlborough&mdash;were heartless and
unprincipled.  There was some ground for his belief,
but he sometimes excepted the wrong persons.
</p>

<p>
All these facts and feelings floated through Celia's
mind, and she felt that to bring her wishes to light
would probably hinder their accomplishment.
She sat silent and thoughtful.
</p>

<p>
"Cicely," she asked at length, rather abruptly,
"do you not find some parts of the Bible very
hard to understand?"
</p>

<p>
"A vast sight, my dear!" said Cicely; "a vast
sight!  Sure there's a deal that's main hard to a
poor old ignorant body such as me."
</p>

<p>
"Then what do you do, Cicely, when you come to
a piece that you cannot understand?"
</p>

<p>
"Leave it alone, my dear.  There's somewhat
about the middle of the Book&mdash;I can't say the
words right, never has 'em pat&mdash;about the road
being made so straight and smooth like that the
very fools can't shape to lose the way.  Well, I
think the Book's a bit like that itself.  For I am a
fool, Mrs. Celia, and I won't go to deny it.  Surely
God will show me all I want, and all that's meant
for me, thinks I; and so what I can't understand
I think ben't for the likes of me, and I leave it to
them 'tis meant for."
</p>

<p>
"Now all about those Jews, on their way to the
Promised Land, and the forty years they spent in
the wilderness,&mdash;I cannot see what that has to do
with us."
</p>

<p>
"Eh!  Mrs. Celia, my dear, don't you go to say
that!" urged old Cicely, earnestly.  "Wasn't they
hard-hearted and stiff-necked folks? and ben't we
hard-hearteder and stiff-neckeder?"
</p>

<p>
"But is it not very gloomy, Cicely, to be always
thinking of death, and judgment, and such horrid
things?" said Celia, with a little shudder.
</p>

<p>
"Never thinks about 'em, my dear," was old
Cicely's short answer.
</p>

<p>
"Why, Cicely!  I thought religious people were
always thinking about them?"
</p>

<p>
"Don't know nought about religious people, as
you call 'em," said Cicely; "never came across
one.  All I know is, <i>I</i> never thinks&mdash;not any
while&mdash;about death, and judgment, and such like.  You
see, I haven't got to die just now,&mdash;when I have,
it'll be a hard pull, I dare say; but there's dying
grace, and there's living grace.  He don't give
dying grace&mdash;at least so I think&mdash;till we come to
dying.  So I leave that alone.  He knows when
I'm to die, and He'll be sure to see to it that I
have grace to die with.  And as to the judgment,
my dear, I have no more to do with that than the
other,&mdash;a sight less, it seems to me.  For we have
all got to die; but if I understand the Book right,
them that trust in Him haven't no judgment for to
stand.  If He has taken all my sins away, what
am I to be judged for?  Don't you see, Mrs. Celia?
Eh, no! 'tis not we need think over the
judgment, but the poor souls that have to stand
it&mdash;who will not take Christ, and have nought of
their own."
</p>

<p>
Celia sat silently gazing out of the window on
the fair sward and trees of Ashcliffe Park.  She
had not found any answer when Lucy burst in,
with no previous ceremony, and with the
exclamation, "What are you doing here, Celia?  Didn't
you hear the bell for the sermon?  Oh, me!  I
wish it was over!"
</p>

<p>
Perhaps Lucy was not the only person who
wished it.  The Sunday-evening sermon at Ashcliffe
was a rather fearful institution to more mature
and sedate persons than she.  First, one of
the Squire's sons&mdash;Harry, when he was at home,
Charley, if not&mdash;read the Psalms and Lessons for
the day, and it was necessary that they should be
read very loud.  This was disagreeable when they
contained a number of Hebrew names, which
Charley, at least, had no idea how to pronounce.
He was consequently reduced to make hits at
them, which passed muster in all but very flagrant
cases, as, fortunately for him, his father was little
wiser than himself.  This ordeal over, the sermon
itself was read by the Squire, and commonly lasted
about an hour and a half.  It was never very
entertaining, being most frequently a discourse on the
moral virtues, in tone heathenish, and in style
dreary beyond measure.  After the sermon, the
whole family repeated the Lord's Prayer,&mdash;any
other prayers the Squire, being a layman, would
have thought it semi-sacrilege to read.  Then, all
remaining in their places, Charley and Lucy were
called up to repeat their catechism, each answering
alternately, and standing in as stiff a position
as possible.  When this was over, they had to
repeat the text of Dr. Braithwaite's sermon, and
that one who remembered it best was rewarded
with a silver groat.  This was the last act of the
drama, the young lady and gentleman being then
pounced upon by Cicely and ordered off to bed,
after saying good-night all round.  The Squire
finished the day with a bowl of punch, and a
game of cards or backgammon, in which it never
occurred to him to see any incongruity with his
previous occupations.  Later came supper, after
which the ladies retired, leaving the Squire to
finish his punch alone; and the whole household
was in bed by ten at the latest.
</p>

<p>
The sermon this evening was a discourse upon
covetousness&mdash;a vice to which none of the hearers
were addicted; and after listening to a learned
prologue concerning the common derivation of
misery and miser, with a number of quotations
and instances to show it, Celia's thoughts began to
wander, and roamed off once more to her conversation
with old Cicely.
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
"The <i>Gazette</i>, Sir!" said Harry, coming into the
room in boots and spurs one morning about three
months after the Sunday in question.  "Great
tumults in London regarding one Dr. Sacheverell,[<a id="chap01fn12text"></a><a href="#chap01fn12">12</a>]
who hath preached a Jacobite sermon and much
inflamed the populace; and 'tis said the Queen will
not consent to his being deprived.  Likewise"&mdash;
</p>

<p>
"Hang all Jacobites!" cried the Squire.
</p>

<p>
"Likewise," pursued his son, "'tis said the
Pretender will take a journey to Rome to speak
with the Pope, and"&mdash;
</p>

<p>
"Hang the Pretender twice over, and the Pope
three times!" thundered his father.
</p>

<p>
"Hardly necessary, Sir, though you might find
it agreeable," observed Harry, in his courtly way.
"Moreover, 'tis thought he is gathering an army,
wherewith he means to come against our coasts, if
any evil should chance to Her Majesty."
</p>

<p>
"Let him come!" growled the Squire.  "We'll
send him packing in half the time!  Anything
else?"
</p>

<p>
"I see nothing of import," replied Harry, handing
the newspaper to him.
</p>

<p>
"Who is Dr. Sacheverell, Harry?" asked Celia
from the window, where she sat with her work.
</p>

<p>
"There is but little regarding him," was the
answer.  "He is of Derbyshire family, and was
sometime tutor at Oxford.  'Twas on the 5th of
November, Gunpowder Plot day last, that he
preached before the corporation of London, saith
one of the newspapers&mdash;I brought the <i>News-Letter</i>
as well as the <i>Gazette</i>&mdash;and speaking upon 'perils
among false brethren,' which he chose for his
discourse, he denounced the Bishops and the Lord
Treasurer,[<a id="chap01fn13text"></a><a href="#chap01fn13">13</a>] and spake of the Lords who aided in
the Revolution as men that had done unpardonable sin."
</p>

<p>
"Where is all that in the <i>Gazette</i>?" asked the
Squire, turning the little sheet of paper about, and
looking down the columns to catch the name of
the obnoxious preacher.
</p>

<p>
"Not in the <i>Gazette</i>, what I said last, Sir,"
answered Harry; "'tis in the sermon, whereof I
brought a copy, thinking that you might wish to
see it.  The bookseller of whom I had it told me
that a prodigious number had been sold.  Methinks
he said thirty thousand."
</p>

<p>
"Thirty thousand sermons!" exclaimed Lucy,
under her breath.
</p>

<p>
"Leather and prunella!" observed the Squire
from behind his <i>Gazette</i>.
</p>

<p>
"Maybe so, Sir," responded Harry, very civilly.
"Yet a sermon sold by the thousand, one would
think, should be worth reading."
</p>

<p>
"Hold your tongue, lad! men don't buy what is
worth reading by the cart-load!" growled the
Squire.  "'Tis only trash that is disposed of in
that way."
</p>

<p>
"Very likely, Sir," responded Harry as before.
"Yet give me leave to ask how many prayer-books
have been printed in England since the reign of
Queen Elizabeth?"
</p>

<p>
The Squire only grunted, being deep in the
<i>Gazette</i>, and Harry turned his attention elsewhere.
</p>

<p>
"I should like to have heard Dr. Sacheverell,"
said Celia, timidly.
</p>

<p>
"Nonsense, Celia!" answered Isabella from her
embroidery-frame.  "You don't want to hear a
man preach treason!"
</p>

<p>
"I was not thinking of the treason," sighed Celia.
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
"Celia, why do you want to hear Dr. Sacheverell?"
asked Charley, as he sat on the step of the dais
which elevated the window above the rest of the
chamber.
</p>

<p>
Celia hesitated, colored, and went on with her
work without answering.  She and Charley were
alone in the room.
</p>

<p>
"If you wanted to hear what he had to say
about what they call treason, you don't need to
be afraid of telling <i>me</i>," said Charley.  "I don't
know whether I shall not take up with treason
myself."
</p>

<p>
"O Charley!" exclaimed Celia.  "Don't talk in
that way.  Think how angry Father would be if
he heard you!"
</p>

<p>
"O Celestina!" exclaimed Charley in his turn.
This was his pet name for his favorite sister.
Had she possessed a long name, he would probably
have abbreviated it; as she had a short one, he
extended it.  "O Celestina!  I am so tired of being
good!  I am tired of Sundays, and grammar, and
the catechism, and sermons, and keeping things
tidy, and going to church, and being scolded, and&mdash;I'm
tired of everything!" said Charley, suddenly
lumping together the remainder of his heterogeneous
catalogue.
</p>

<p>
"Charley!" said Celia, slowly and wonderingly.
</p>

<p>
"I am!  And I am half determined to go off,
and have no more of it!  Father may say what he
likes about treason, and hang the Pretender as
often as he pleases; but I say 'tis a grand thing to
think of the King's son, whom we have kicked out,
living on charity in a foreign land, and trying with
such wonderful patience to recover the throne of
his fathers!  I should like to be with him, and
bivouac&mdash;isn't that what Harry calls it?&mdash;bivouac in
forests, and march on day after day, always seeing
something new, and then at last have a battle!
Wouldn't it be glorious?"
</p>

<p>
"For you to fight with Harry, and one of you
kill the other?  No, I don't think it would."
</p>

<p>
"I didn't say anything about fighting with
Harry," resumed Charley, a little sulkily.  "No, I
should not like that.  But as to anything else, I
just tell you, Celia, that if some day I am not to
be found, you will know I am gone to St. Germains
to fight for the King&mdash;the King!"  And Charley
drew himself up at least two inches as he said the
last words.
</p>

<p>
"Hush, Charley, do!"
</p>

<p>
"I won't hush!  And I really mean it!"
</p>

<p>
"Charley, I shall have to tell Father, if you talk
any more nonsense like that!" said Celia, really
alarmed.
</p>

<p>
"Celia, do you know what it is to feel downright
wicked?" asked Charley, in a different tone.
</p>

<p>
"Yes&mdash;no&mdash;not as you mean, I fancy."
</p>

<p>
"No, I don't think you do.  I wish you did."
</p>

<p>
"Charley!"
</p>

<p>
"Well, I mean, I wish I didn't!  Father talks
of hanging things; I feel sometimes as if I could
hang everything."
</p>

<p>
"Me?" demanded Celia, smiling.
</p>

<p>
"No, I wouldn't hang you; and I wouldn't hang
Mother," pursued Charley, meditatively.  "Nor
Bay Fairy, nor Lucy, nor the black cat; nor Harry&mdash;I
think not; nor Cicely, except first thing in a
morning when she rouses me up out of a nice
sleep, or last thing at night when she packs me off
to bed whether I will or not.  I am not sure about
Father.  As to the rest, they would have to look
out for themselves."
</p>

<p>
"Now, Charley!" said Celia, laughing.
</p>

<p>
"Celia, you don't know what it is to feel wicked,
I wish I could get something to make me&mdash;not
keep good, because I have to do&mdash;but make me
want to be good."
</p>

<p>
Celia was silent for a moment.  Then she said,
very slowly and hesitatingly, "Charley, I suppose
we shall only want to be good, when we want to
please God, and to be like Jesus Christ."
</p>

<p>
"I don't know anything about that," said
Charley, turning round to look at her.
</p>

<p>
"I know very little about it," said Celia, blushing.
"But I have begun to think, Charley&mdash;only
just lately&mdash;that we ought to care more about
pleasing God than anything else."
</p>

<p>
"Is that what makes you such a darling of a
sister?" said Charley.  "I'll think about it if it be.
You are always trying to please everybody, it
seems to me.  But I don't think I could keep it
up, Celia.  I don't care much about pleasing
anybody but myself."
</p>

<p>
"Charley," said his sister, with a great effort,
"there is a verse in the Bible which I was reading
this morning&mdash;'Even Christ pleased not Himself.'"  She
spoke very shyly; but she loved this younger
brother dearly, and longed to see him grow up a
really great and good man.  And she found it
easier to talk to Charley, Lucy, and Cicely than to
others.  She would not have dared to quote a text
to Henrietta.
</p>

<p>
"Well, but you know we can't be like Him,"
said Charley, reverently.
</p>

<p>
"We must, before we can go to heaven."
</p>

<p>
"Well, then, I might as well give up at once!"
answered Charley, beginning to whistle.
</p>

<p>
"Oh no, Charley dear!" said Celia, so earnestly,
that Charley stopped whistling, and looked up in
her face.  "He will help us to do right if we try.
I do want you to grow up a good man, loving God
and doing good to men.  Won't you ask Him,
Charley?"
</p>

<p>
"Well, perhaps&mdash;I'll see about it," said Charley,
as his sister stroked the light hair affectionately
away from his brow.  "At any rate, I don't think
I'll go to St. Germains just yet.  You are a dear
old Celestina!"

"Harry!" said Celia, coming down with her
cloak and hood on, one fine day in the following
spring, "one of the pegs in the closet in
our room is loose; will you make it secure for us
while we are walking?"
</p>

<p>
The whole family were going for an excursion
in the woods, as it was Lucy's birthday, and
Harry's sprained ankle kept him at home.  He
could stand without pain for a short time, but
could not walk far; and a horse would not have
been able to carry him through the thick
underwood.  Delay was suggested; but, as Lucy very
truly, if somewhat selfishly, asserted, another day
would not have been her birthday.  All things
considered, the Squire had decided that the
excursion should not be put off, and the party set out
accordingly.  After they were gone, Harry went
up to Celia's room, to see what would be required.
The setting to rights of the offending peg was
soon effected.  He was retiring from the closet,
when he set his foot upon a little round substance,
which he guessed to be the head of a nail sticking
up from the floor of the closet close to one of the
back panels.
</p>

<p>
"Ah!" observed Harry, apostrophizing the
nail, "you must come out.  You will be tearing
Miss Lucy's gown, and she won't like having to
mend it."
</p>

<p>
Harry accordingly proceeded to attempt the
removal of the nail.  But he found to his surprise
that neither his hand nor his tools seemed strong
enough to pull it out.  Its position, close to the
back of the closet, made it all the more difficult.
Was it really a nail?  He looked at it more closely.
It had a brass head, and Harry came to the
conclusion that it was a knob placed there on
purpose.  But for what purpose?  It would go
neither backwards nor forwards; but when Harry
tried to pull it to one side, to his astonishment a
little door flew open, so neatly fitted into the
closet floor as to defy detection, the nail or knob
being fixed in the midst.  Below the little door
appeared a tiny box, with a second brass knob
fixed in it.  At the bottom was a brass plate, from
a small round hole in which the knob protruded.
</p>

<p>
"Now then," remarked Harry, "let me look at
you.  What are <i>you</i> for?"
</p>

<p>
He very soon discovered that upon touching it.
The moment that the little knob was pushed
inwards, the whole panel in the back of the closet
suddenly sprang back, showing that it was in
reality a concealed door, the catch closing it
having been liberated by pressing the little knob in
the tiny box.  What was behind the door it was
impossible to see without a candle, for the closet
was a deep one, and the opening of its door cut
off the light from the bedroom window.  Harry
quietly came out of the closet, locked the bedroom
door, and went to his own chamber to fetch a
taper and his sword.  He was determined to
follow up his discovery.
</p>

<p>
The light of the candle revealed no array of
skeletons, but a narrow passage, which he saw, on
stepping into it, to be the head of a very narrow
spiral staircase.  With the candle in one hand,
and the sword in the other, Harry, in whose
mental vocabulary fear had no place, calmly
walked down the staircase.  The excitement of the
adventure overpowered any pain which he felt
from his ankle.  A faint smell of dried roses met
him at the foot of the stairs.  On the right hand
stood a heavy door.  Harry gave it a strong push,
and being unlatched, it slowly opened and admitted
him.  He stood in a very small square chamber.
There was no window.  A table was in the middle,
two chairs stood against the wall, and in one
corner was a handsome chest on which two books
were lying.  All the furniture was of carved oak.
Harry opened the books, and then the chest.  The
former were a Latin missal and breviary; the
latter was occupied by a set of church vestments,
a crucifix, a thurible, and sundry other articles,
whose use was no mystery to the travelled
discoverer.
</p>

<p>
"So you are a priest's hiding-place," said Harry,
dryly, to the concealed chamber.  "So much is
plain.  They say mass at this table.  Well, I did
not know we had one of these at Ashcliffe.  I
wonder how many years it is since this was
inhabited?  I protest!&mdash;upon my word, I do believe
it is inhabited now!"
</p>

<p>
He had suddenly perceived that while on the
stairs the dust lay thick, there was none resting
on the furniture within the chamber.  Books,
chest, chairs, table&mdash;all bore evidence of having
been used so recently, that no considerable
accumulation of dust had time to gather on them.
Harry looked coolly around, and descried another
door, opposite to the one by which he had entered.
Opening this, he found himself at the summit of a
second spiral staircase, down which he went&mdash;down,
down, until he fancied that he must be descending
below the foundations of the house.  At length the
spiral form of the staircase ended, and a further
flight of steps ran straight down.  Harry wondered
whether he was going into the bowels of the earth,
but he kept onwards, until once more stopped by
a door.  This door opened readily, being unlatched
like the others, and he looked out into darkness.
Casting his eyes upwards, he saw, in the direction
wherein he supposed the sky should be, a small
round patch of blue.
</p>

<p>
"Well, you were a cunning fox who planned
this hole!" thought he.  "One end opens into the
closet in Celia's room, and the other into the old
well in the garden.  There must be some means of
climbing up out of the well, I presume, and the
worthy gentleman who makes this his abode is
probably well acquainted with them.  I wonder if
my father and mother know of this?  If not, I had
better make up the entrance, and not tell them.
My mother would be too frightened to sleep in any
peace if she knew that such a place was hidden in
the house, and my father would rouse all Devonshire
about it.  I wonder, too, who they are that
use it?  Are they still priests, or Jacobite
fugitives?  or are they highwaymen?  Whatever they
be, I must make up this door, as soon as I am a
little better able to exert myself."
</p>

<p>
Thus thinking, Harry withdrew from the secret
chamber, and regained Celia's room.  Pulling to
the door, he found that the panel and the hidden
box closed each with a spring.  He left the
bedroom, and went down-stairs meditating upon his
discovery.[<a id="chap02fn1text"></a><a href="#chap02fn1">1</a>]
</p>

<p>
A fortnight later, when his ankle had regained
strength, he took the opportunity, when both the
sisters were out, to make a second visit to the
secret chamber.  He found its arrangements
slightly altered&mdash;a proof that its mysterious
occupant had been there within a few days.  The
books were gone, and one of the chairs was now
standing by the table.  Harry dragged some
ponderous logs of wood to the outer door which led
into the well, and by means of these barricaded
the door effectually against any return of the refugee.
</p>

<p>
During the interval he had taken the opportunity
of asking a few questions of different persons,
which might give him some idea whether they
were aware of the existence of this concealed
chamber.
</p>

<p>
"Mother," he asked, one evening, when Madam
Passmore had been lamenting the sad fact that
things wore out much sooner than when she was a
girl, "had you ever any of that fine carved
furniture like Madam Harvey's?"
</p>

<p>
"No, my dear, not a bit," said his mother.
</p>

<p>
"Bell," he asked, on another occasion, "do you
ever hear rats or mice in your wainscot?"
</p>

<p>
"Oh, they tease me infinitely!" answered
Isabella.  "They make noises behind the wainscot
till I cannot sleep, and for the last week I have
put cotton wool in my ears to keep out the sound."
</p>

<p>
"Cicely," he inquired, lastly, "did you ever see
a ghost?"
</p>

<p>
"No, Master Harry, I never have," replied
Cicely, mysteriously, thus hinting that there might
be some people who had done so.  "I never see
one, nor never want.  But they do haunt old
houses, that's a truth."
</p>

<p>
"How do you know that if you never saw one?"
laughed Harry.
</p>

<p>
"Well, my dear!" exclaimed Cicely, "if you'd a
been down with me in the scullery one night last
week&mdash;I couldn't sleep, and I went down for to get
a bit of victuals, and washed my hands in the
scullery&mdash;I say, if you'd a-heard the din they
made over my head, you might have thought
somewhat."
</p>

<p>
"Who made it, Cicely?"
</p>

<p>
"Them!" said Cicely, in a mysterious whisper.
"Nay, I never saw none, but my grandmother's
aunt's mother-in-law, she did."
</p>

<p>
"Ah! she is a good way off us," said Harry,
satirically.  "But you know, this house is rather
too new for ghosts.  A fine old castle, now, with
all manner of winding stairs and secret passages&mdash;that
would be the place to see a ghost."
</p>

<p>
"Eh! my dear, don't you give me the horrors!"
cried Cicely.  "Why, I could never sleep in my
bed if I lived in a place where them secret places
and such was&mdash;no, never lie quiet, I couldn't!
Nay, Master Harry, nobody never seed no ghosteses
in this house.  I've lived here eight-and-twenty
year come Martlemas, and I ought to know."
</p>

<p>
"And pray, Cicely, who was your great-grandmother's
first cousin's niece, or whatever she were? and
what did she see?"
</p>

<p>
"My grandmother's aunt's mother-in-law, Master,"
corrected Cicely.  "She see a little child in a
white coat."
</p>

<p>
"How very extraordinary!" commented Harry gravely.
</p>

<p>
"Master Harry, I'm certain sure you don't believe
a word of it, for all you look so grave," said
old Cicely, shaking her head sorrowfully.
</p>

<p>
"I can't say that I do at present.  But you see
I have not heard the particulars yet."
</p>

<p>
"Then you shall, Master," said old Cicely,
rather excitedly.  "'Twas at Dagworth in Suffolk,
in the house of one Master Osborne, where she
served as chambermaid.  He had been a while in
the house, had the ghost, and nobody couldn't get
to see him&mdash;no, not the parson, though he used to
reason with him on doctrine and godliness.  They
oft heard him a-calling for meat and drink, with
the voice of a child of one year, which meat being
put in a certain place was no more seen.  He said
his name was Malke.  And after a while, one day
she spoke to him and begged him for a sight of
him, promising not to touch him.  Whereupon he
appeared to her as a young child in a white coat,
and told her that he was a mortal child, stole by
the good-folk,[<a id="chap02fn2text"></a><a href="#chap02fn2">2</a>] and that he was born at Lanaham,
and wore a hat that made him invisible, and so,
quoth he, doth many another.  He spoke English
after the manner of the country, and had many
roguish and laughter-stirring sayings, that at last
they grew not to fear him."[<a id="chap02fn3text"></a><a href="#chap02fn3">3</a>]
</p>

<p>
"How long did he stay there?"
</p>

<p>
"Now you are asking me more than I know,
Master.  But don't you never go to say again that
there's no such things as ghosteses, when my
grandmother's aunt's mother-in-law seen him with
her own two eyes!"
</p>

<p>
"And Mr. Osborne kept no dogs, or cats, I suppose?"
</p>

<p>
"Master Harry, you don't believe it!  Well, to
be sure, I never did!  You'll be saying next thing
that there's no such things as the good-folk, when
I've seen their dancing-rings on the grass many a
hundred times!  I'm sore afeared, Master Harry,
that it haven't done you no good a-going for a
soldier&mdash;I am."
</p>

<p>
And Harry found that all his arguments produced
no further effect than the conviction of old
Cicely that he had been in bad company.  From
the information thus gained, however, he formed
these conclusions:&mdash;First, His mother knew nothing
about the secret chamber.  Secondly, Cicely
was equally ignorant.  Thirdly, It was situated, as
he had surmised&mdash;above the scullery or behind
it&mdash;probably both&mdash;and below his sister Isabella's
bedroom.  Fourthly, It had been inhabited as
recently as the preceding week.  All the more reason,
he thought, for stopping up the means of ingress;
and all the more for not revealing to old Cicely
that her ghost was in all probability a Popish
priest.
</p>

<p>
On the evening of the spring day upon which
Harry thus barred the refugee out of his hiding-place,
Celia was strolling through the park alone.
She fed the fawns and the swans on the ornamental
water, and wandered on with no definite object,
until she reached the boundary of her father's
grounds.  She sat down on the grass near a large
laurel, and became lost in thought.  There
happened at this place to be a small gap in the hedge
near her, through which her position was plainly
observable from the road.  She started as she
heard a sudden appeal made to her:
</p>

<p>
"Young Madam, pray you a penny, for the love
of God!"
</p>

<p>
Celia turned and looked at the speaker.  He was
a dark, good-looking man, dressed in clothes which
had once been handsome, but were now ragged and
thread-bare.  His eyes, dark, sunken, and very
bright, were fixed earnestly upon her.  She held
out to him the penny for which he asked, when he
said, abruptly:
</p>

<p>
"Your pardon, Madam! but are you Squire
Passmore's daughter?"
</p>

<p>
"Yes, I am Celia Passmore," she replied, thinking
nothing of the query.
</p>

<p>
"Be not too certain of it," answered the stranger,
softly.  "God and our Lady bless you!"
</p>

<p>
And gently taking the offered coin from Celia's
hand, he withdrew before she could recover from
her horror at the discovery that she had been
conversing with a Papist.  When she recovered
herself, his words came back to her with strange
meaning.  The blessing she took to be merely his
way of thanking her for the alms which she had
bestowed.  But had he not told her not to be too
sure of something?  Of what?  Had she said
anything to him beyond telling her name?  Celia
concluded that the poor fellow must have been wrong
in his head, and began to feel very compassionate
towards him.  She sauntered back to the house,
and into old Cicely's room, where she found its
occupant mending stockings, with her old brown
Bible lying open on the table before her.
</p>

<p>
"Cicely, I have had such an odd adventure."
</p>

<p>
"Have you so, Mrs. Celia?  What was it, my dear?"
</p>

<p>
"Why, a poor man begged of me over the hedge,
and said such strange things!&mdash;asked me my
name, and told me not to be too sure of it!  Was
it not droll?"
</p>

<p>
Instead of a laugh rising to her lips, as Celia
expected, a strange light sprang to old Cicely's eyes
as she lifted her head and gazed at her.  Not a
glad light&mdash;far from it; a wild, startled, sad
expression, which Celia could not understand.
</p>

<p>
"Ay, sweetheart!" said the old woman, in a
voice not like her usual tones.  "Did he so?  And
what manner of man?"
</p>

<p>
"Oh, not bad-looking," answered Celia.  "A
comely man, with black hair and eyes.  His clothes
had been good, but they were very bad now, and
he was a Papist, for he said, 'Our Lady bless
you.'"
</p>

<p>
"A Papist!" cried old Cicely, in a voice of horror.
</p>

<p>
"Yes," said Celia, smiling at her tone.  "Why,
Cicely, are you afraid of being murdered because
there is a Papist in the county?"
</p>

<p>
"Eh no, my dear," answered old Cicely, slowly;
"that's not it.  Poor soul!  God comfort you
when you come to know!"
</p>

<p>
"Come to know what, Cicely?"
</p>

<p>
"What you've never been told yet, my dear&mdash;and
yet he told you, if you did but know."
</p>

<p>
"I don't understand you, Cicely."
</p>

<p>
"I am glad you don't, my dear."
</p>

<p>
"But tell me what you mean."
</p>

<p>
"No, Mrs. Celia.  Ask Madam, if you must.
Tell her what you have told me.  But if you'll
take my counsel, you'll never ask her as long as
you live."
</p>

<p>
"Cicely, what riddles are you talking?" replied
Celia.  "I will ask Mother."
</p>

<p>
The opportunity for doing so came the next day,
about an hour after dinner.  Madam Passmore sat
knitting peacefully in her especial chair in the
parlor.  Henrietta was absent, superintending
household affairs; and Isabella, with the velvet
ornaments tied round her neck and arms, was
occupied as usual with her endless embroidery-frame.
</p>

<p>
"We shall have an assembly on Monday,"
observed Madam Passmore, speaking to nobody in
particular.
</p>

<p>
"That is right!" said Isabella, rather less
languidly than usual.  "I am so glad!  Who are
coming, Mother?"
</p>

<p>
"Dr. Braithwaite and his wife, Squire and
Madam Harvey, and Squire and Madam Rowe."
</p>

<p>
"Nobody else?" asked Isabella, in a disappointed tone.
</p>

<p>
"Well, that I don't know, child," answered her
mother.  "Maybe some of the young folks may
come from over the hill."
</p>

<p>
"Are they coming to dinner?"
</p>

<p>
"No, for the afternoon.  Put on your blue
satin petticoats, girls, and your best gowns; and
Bell, bid Harry to have ready the basset-table in
the corner.  We will draw it out when 'tis wanted."
</p>

<p>
"But you will have dancing, Mother?" said Isabella,
in a tone which indicated that her enjoyment
would be spoilt without it.
</p>

<p>
"Please yourself, child," said Madam Passmore.
"I don't know who you'll dance with, unless
Johnny and Frank Rowe should come.  The old
folks will want no dancing, I should think; they
would rather have a quiet game."
</p>

<p>
"How tiresome!" said Isabella.
</p>

<p>
"Well, I don't think so," replied Madam Passmore.
"When you come to my time of life, you
won't want to be sent spinning about the room
like so many teetotums.  Yet I was reckoned a
good dancer once, to be sure."
</p>

<p>
"And you liked it, Mother?" asked Celia.
</p>

<p>
"Yes, I suppose I did.  I was young and foolish,"
said Madam Passmore, with a little sigh.
"But really, when you come to think it over, 'tis
only fit for children, I think.  I would rather have
a good game of hunt-the-slipper&mdash;there is more
sense in it, and quite as much moving about, and
a great deal more fun."
</p>

<p>
"So very vulgar!" sighed Isabella, contemptuously.
</p>

<p>
"Very vulgar, Madam!" bowed Harry, who had
entered while his mother was speaking; "almost
as vulgar as eating and sleeping."
</p>

<p>
"I wish you would go away, Harry.  I don't
like arguing with you."
</p>

<p>
"By all means, Madam," said Harry, bowing
himself out of the parlor.
</p>

<p>
Madam Passmore laughed.  "Well, girls," she
said, "I think I shall have to give the ladies some
tea, though it is a new-fangled drink; and as you
are used to pour it for your sisters, Bell, you had
better take the charge of it."
</p>

<p>
"Very well, Mother."
</p>

<p>
"And, Celia, can you get some flowers and bits
of green from the evergreens?  They will look
better than nothing in the jars.  That great laurel
at the other end of the park can spare some,
and as you take long walks, I leave that to you."
</p>

<p>
"O Mother!" suddenly cried Celia, in a voice
which showed that her thoughts were on anything
but evergreens, "I want to tell you something.
Yesterday I was sitting by that great laurel, when
a man begged of me through the hedge.  I gave
him a trifle, and he asked me if I were Squire
Passmore's daughter.  I told him yes, my name
was Celia Passmore; and he told me in answer
not to be too certain of it.  Was it not droll?
But the thing yet more strange was, that when I
told Cicely of it, she said I had better tell
you&mdash;no, she said I had better not tell you&mdash;but that
you could tell me what it meant if I asked you.
So very strange!  What did it mean, Mother?"
</p>

<p>
Madam Passmore was silent for a few moments.
When she spoke, it was to say, in quite another
tone, softer and tenderer than her previous one,
"Thou art nineteen, Celia, my dear."
</p>

<p>
"Yes, Mother," answered Celia, rather surprised
at the information.  "I was nineteen on the third
of June."
</p>

<p>
"Ay, born the same year as Bell," said Madam
Passmore, gravely, and Celia thought a little
sadly.  "Well, I will tell thee, my dear, for
thou oughtest to know, and thou art now a
woman grown.  Ay, I will tell thee, but wait
until Tuesday.  After the assembly will be better."
</p>

<p>
Squire Passmore was riding leisurely home,
after having himself carried the invitation to
his old friends Mr. and Mrs. Harvey of Ellersley.
He had nearly reached his own gates, when
he suddenly pulled up to avoid running over
a pedestrian.  The latter met him as he turned a
corner, and was apparently too deeply engaged in
his occupation&mdash;that of searching into a portfolio
in his hand&mdash;to see any one coming.  He was a
young man of some six-and-twenty years, and the
brightness of his dark, penetrating eyes struck the
Squire as he looked up and hastily drew to
one side with an apology.
</p>

<p>
"Your servant, Sir!  I beg your pardon for
my carelessness."
</p>

<p>
"Another time," said the Squire, in his hearty
voice, "I should advise you to delay looking
into your portfolio till you are round the corner."
</p>

<p>
"Thank you for your advice, which I shall
certainly take," returned the young man.  "Might
I ask&mdash;can I be mistaken in thinking that I
am addressing Squire Passmore, of Ashcliffe Hall?"
</p>

<p>
"My name is John Passmore," said the Squire,
"and I live at Ashcliffe.  Do you want anything
with me?"
</p>

<p>
"I thought I could not be mistaken," answered
the young man, with a very deferential bow.  "My
object in addressing you, Sir, is to request the very
great favor of your permission to take a few
sketches of your fine old Hall.  I am sketching in
this neighborhood in the employ of Sir Godfrey
Kneller, the great London painter&mdash;you have
surely heard of him&mdash;and if"&mdash;
</p>

<p>
"A good sensible Whig," interrupted the Squire.
"If you want to sketch the Hall for him, you
shall have leave to draw all the four sides;
if you like.  You are a painter, are you?  I thought
you must be some sort of a moonstruck fellow&mdash;painter,
author, or what not&mdash;that you did not see
me coming."
</p>

<p>
"Permit me to express my very great obligations,"
said the artist.  "Might I venture so far as
to ask your leave to take one sketch inside?
I have been told there is a fine carved oak staircase"&mdash;
</p>

<p>
"Come and dine with me," replied the Squire,
heartily, "and sketch the staircase by all means.
We dine at twelve o'clock&mdash;old-fashioned folks,
Mr.&mdash;&mdash;I have not the pleasure"&mdash;
</p>

<p>
"Stevens, Sir&mdash;Cuthbert Stevens, at your
service&mdash;and very much"&mdash;
</p>

<p>
"Ah! odd name, Cuthbert, but an old name&mdash;yes,
a good old name.  To-morrow at twelve,
Mr. Stevens&mdash;very glad to see you."
</p>

<p>
And away rode the hospitable and unsuspicious
man, leaving on the face of Cuthbert Stevens a
look of amused contempt.
</p>

<p>
"'Moonstruck!'" he whispered to himself.
"We shall see which is the cleverer, John
Passmore, Esquire&mdash;we shall see."
</p>

<p>
"Lucy, my dear," said the Squire to his wife
when he came in, "I have asked a gentleman to
dinner to-morrow;&mdash;a painter&mdash;making sketches
for Sir Godfrey Kneller&mdash;monstrous clever
fellow!&mdash;take your portrait in no time&mdash;wants to draw
the Hall."
</p>

<p>
When the Squire conveyed his information in
this abrupt and detached style, Madam Passmore
knew from experience that he was not altogether
satisfied with his own act, and desired to justify
himself in his own eyes.  He was, in truth, beginning
to feel rather uneasy.  Though he called the
artist a "monstrous clever fellow," he had not
seen a single sketch; he had taken the man on
his own word, and at his own valuation; he had
yielded to the charm of his voice and manner; and
now that this was withdrawn, he began to doubt
whether he had done well in introducing a
complete stranger into the bosom of his family.  So
Madam Passmore, seeing this, and also acting on
her favorite maxim of "what must be, must,"
quietly said, "Very well, John," and left her
husband to his own devices.
</p>

<p>
Noon came, and with it Mr. Cuthbert Stevens.
The Squire inspected him as he entered, and
could find nothing with which to be dissatisfied.
His taste in dress was excellent, his manners were
faultless; and the Squire began to think his first
thoughts had been the best.  Dinner passed without
a single <i>contretemps</i>.  The stranger talked with
the Squire about hunting and poaching, and was
quite alive to the enormities of the latter; to
Charley upon snaring rabbits and making
rabbit-hutches; to Henrietta and Isabella upon the
fashions and London life (with which he seemed
perfectly familiar); and told Madam Passmore of
a new method of distilling cordial waters of which
she had not previously heard.  Of Celia he took
little apparent notice.  The family began to think
that they had lighted on a very agreeable and
accomplished man; and when dinner was over, and
the sketch of the staircase made&mdash;(which latter the
Squire, though no artist, could see was a faithful
copy, and pronounced "as like as two peas")&mdash;the
stranger was pressed to remain longer, but this
offer, with many thanks, Mr. Stevens declined.
His time, he said, was growing short, and he must
make all possible use of it.  He had still several
sketches to complete before quitting the neighborhood;
but he could assure Mr. Passmore that he
would never forget the kindness shown him at
Ashcliffe, and would inform Sir Godfrey of it on his
return to London.
</p>

<p>
"Well, Sir, if you will remain no longer," said
Madam Passmore, her kind heart compassionating
his probably precarious circumstances, "you will
put one of these raised pies in your pocket for your
journey?  I think you liked them at dinner."
</p>

<p>
The artist gratefully accepted the offer.  With
a very respectful bow he took leave, Charley
volunteering to accompany him to the gate.  There
was a good deal of conversation on the way
through the park, chiefly on Charley's side, the
stranger contenting himself with an occasional
simple and careless query.  At the gate they
parted&mdash;Charley to run home at the top of his
speed, and Mr. Stevens to walk rather quickly for
half a mile in the direction of Exeter.  Having so
done, he turned aside into a coppice bordering on
the road, and, slackening his pace, commenced
whistling a lively air.  The verse was still
unfinished, when an answering whistle of the same tune
was heard, and the man who had accosted Celia
over the hedge came in view, advancing to meet
him.
</p>

<p>
"Well, Gilbert!" was the artist's greeting, "any
good news?"
</p>

<p>
"The same that I left you with, Father," said
the elder man in reply; "and if you call it good
news, you have the heart of a stone.  I am all but
famished, and sick-tired of being cooped up in that
miserable hole."
</p>

<p>
"And the inquiries, Gilbert?  You told me all
that before, you know."
</p>

<p>
"And much you cared about it!" answered Gilbert,
ill-humoredly, kicking some dead sticks out
of his way.  "Inquiries! no, of course nothing has
come of them, except what we knew before: that
she passes as the third daughter, and she is short
and dark."
</p>

<p>
Stevens sat down on a green knoll.  "What a
surpassing clever man you are, Gilbert Irvine!" he
observed.
</p>

<p>
"Well, Father Cuthbert, you are uncommon
complimentary," remonstrated Gilbert, leaning
back against a tree.  "Seven mortal weeks have I
been cooped up in that dog-hole, with as much to
eat as a sparrow, and wearing myself out, dodging
about to get a glimpse of this girl&mdash;all to please
my Lady and you; never slept in a bed except
just these four nights we have been at Exeter&mdash;and
the only reward of my labors which I have
seen anything of yet, is to be told I am an ass for
my pains: because, of course, that is what you
mean."
</p>

<p>
"My excellent Gilbert, your temper is a little
below perfection.  You shall see what a mistake
you have made.  Look at me.  I have just been
dining with Squire Passmore."
</p>

<p>
Gilbert's mouth opened for an exclamation, but
shut again without one, as if his astonishment
passed the power of words to express.
</p>

<p>
"Now why could not you have done the same?
Seven weeks you have been here, as you say, and
caught one glimpse of the girl; and I, who have
not been here as many days, have already seen
and spoken to her, and found out more about her
than you have.  And I have dined like a prince in
addition, while you are pretty near starving,
Gilbert."
</p>

<p>
"Nice consolation that is to give to a famished
wretch!" snarled Gilbert.  "Father Cuthbert, you
have a heart of stone."
</p>

<p>
"Not quite so hard as that, my friend," answered
Stevens, feeling in his pocket, and bringing out of
it the pie.  "I only wished to show you what a
very ingenious fellow you were.  Eat that."
</p>

<p>
"Where did you get it?" was all the thanks
Gilbert vouchsafed.
</p>

<p>
"It was offered me, and I accepted it," said
Stevens.  "I never say 'No, thank you!' to anything
good.  Always take all you can get, Gilbert."
</p>

<p>
Gilbert was too busy with the pie to answer.
</p>

<p>
"Now listen, Gilbert.  I was wise enough to
take no notice of the girl that any could see: but I
studied her quietly, and I sounded the youngest
brother well.  I am satisfied that none of them
know who she is, and I imagine only the parents
know any thing at all.  She seems very comfortable,
and well taken care of, and will probably be in no
haste to leave; at least so I judge from what I can
see of her disposition, which is quiet and timid.
Then"&mdash;
</p>

<p>
"Father Cuthbert, I wish you would wait a
minute.  ''Tis ill talking between a full man and a
fasting.'  Do let me finish this pie in peace."
</p>

<p>
"Finish it, Gilbert, and much good may it do you."
</p>

<p>
"But how did you get in?" was the question that
followed the last mouthful of the pie.
</p>

<p>
"I represented myself as an artist, in the employ
of Sir Godfrey Kneller "&mdash;
</p>

<p>
"Did you ever see him?"
</p>

<p>
"I once had him shown to me in London.  And
I asked leave to draw the Hall, and the staircase
inside.  I knew, after that, Mr. Passmore would
ask me to dinner."
</p>

<p>
"Can you draw?"
</p>

<p>
"If I could not, my friend, I should have been
unwise to take that character.  I can do a good
many things."
</p>

<p>
"You are a more ingenious man than I am,
Father."
</p>

<p>
"You are not far wrong there, Gilbert,"
complacently assented the disguised priest.
</p>

<p>
"But I cannot believe, Father," pursued Gilbert,
"that you came over from France only to see
Sir Edward's daughter."
</p>

<p>
"I protest, Gilbert, you are even more
surpassing than I took you for!  It must be your
conversation with that Jezebel of yours which has
dulled your wits.  You were a sharper fellow
once."
</p>

<p>
"You are welcome to revile my wife as much as
you please, Father," said Gilbert, calmly.  "I
can't think how in the world I ever came to marry
the daughter of an old, ranting, canting
Covenanter.  The devil must have set me up to it."
</p>

<p>
"Probably he did, my friend," was the reply of
Cuthbert.  "But to relieve your mind: I came
here on secret service&mdash;you will not ask me what
it was.  Suffice it you to know that it was at once
for Church and King."
</p>

<p>
"Well!" sighed Gilbert, "the Church is
infallible&mdash;is she not?&mdash;and immortal: she will get
along all right.  But for the King"&mdash;
</p>

<p>
An expressive pantomime of Gilbert's hands
and shoulders completed the sentence.
</p>

<p>
"Faint-hearted, Gilbert?" asked Stevens, with a
smile.
</p>

<p>
"Faint-hoping, Father," said he.  "The King
will never 'have his ain again.'  Ay! that song you
were whistling by way of signal is to me the
saddest of all our songs.  'Tis easy to chant 'It was
a' for our richtfu' King,'&mdash;or I can even stand
'Lilliburlero;' but 'The King shall have his ain
again'&mdash;it but saddens me, Father Cuthbert.  He
will never have it."
</p>

<p>
"Why, Gilbert, has your solitude made you
hopeless?  You used to have more faith in right,
and in the final triumph of the good cause."
</p>

<p>
"The cause is lost, Father Cuthbert," said
Gilbert, stooping to pick up one of the dry twigs
which lay before him.  "'Tis as dead and dry as
this branch; and as easily to be broken by the
Princess and her Ministers, or by the Elector of
Hanover and his, as I can break this&mdash;so!"
</p>

<p>
And the broken twig fell at Stevens' feet.
</p>

<p>
"Come, Gilbert, come!" said Stevens,
encouragingly.  "Remember how many friends the
King has throughout England, and Scotland, and
Ireland."
</p>

<p>
"Friends! what are they worth?" asked the
other.  "Good to sing 'Awa' Whigs, awa'!' or to
pass their glasses over the water-jug when they
say, 'The King, God bless him!'[<a id="chap02fn4text"></a><a href="#chap02fn4">4</a>]  But how many
of them are ready to put their hands in their
pockets to maintain your good cause?  How
many are ready to melt down their plate, as their
fathers and ours did for King Charles?  How
many would die for the King now, as for his
grandfather then?"
</p>

<p>
"<i>That</i> cause triumphed, Gilbert," said Stevens,
suggestively.
</p>

<p>
"Did it?" answered Gilbert, more suggestively
still.  "How much worse had we been off now,
Father Cuthbert&mdash;how far different, if the one at
St. James's had been called Richard Cromwell
instead of Anne Stuart?  Trust me, England will
henceforth be constant but to one thing&mdash;her
inconstancy.  She will go on, as she hath gone,
from bad to worse, with short reactions every now
and then.  First King Charles&mdash;then my Lord
Protector&mdash;then a little fit of reaction, and King
Charles again.  Then comes King James, and
wounds her pride by being really a King and not
a puppet, and off she goes to Dutch William&mdash;my
Lord Protector over again.  And now, the Princess
Anne"&mdash;
</p>

<p>
"And after her, Gilbert?"
</p>

<p>
"After her?  The saints know!&mdash;at least I hope
they do; for I am sure I don't.  But if these
fellows had the King in to-morrow, they would
kick him out again the day after."
</p>

<p>
"Probably," rejoined Stevens, calmly.  "However,
it does not much matter to me.  I have a
safe refuge in France in either case&mdash;my Lady
Ingram's income to draw upon if we succeed&mdash;and,
if we fail&mdash;well, I have friends on the other side.
And at the worst, the Jesuit College at Rome
would provide me with a shelter for my old age."
</p>

<p>
"Yes, there is no fear for you, Father," said
Gilbert.  "But we poor wretches, who have not
the good fortune to be of your Order&mdash;we are
proscribed exiles.  Should we have been anything
worse under Oliver?"
</p>

<p>
"Why, you might very likely have been in the
pillory," said Stevens, "and had an ear or two
less than now.  And you might have been at
Tyburn."
</p>

<p>
Gilbert took no notice of this flattering allusion.
He answered as if he were pursuing his previous
train of thought:
</p>

<p>
"No, the King will never 'have his ain again.'  There
are two things that England has come to
value above even her throne and her peace: these
are her Protestantism and her liberties.  For these,
and these alone, she will fight to the death.  Of
course the two monsters cannot live long together;
the one must devour the other in the end.  And
whether heresy will swallow liberty, or liberty eat
up heresy,&mdash;our great-grandsons may see, but we
scarcely shall."
</p>

<p>
"On what does it depend, Gilbert?" asked
Stevens, who seemed at once curious to draw out
his companion's ideas, and reluctant to present his
own.
</p>

<p>
"On the man who holds the helm when the two
engage in battle," said Gilbert, thoughtfully.
</p>

<p>
"That is a battle that may last long," hinted
Stevens.
</p>

<p>
"And probably will," replied the other.  "But
when the present notions shall have come to their
full growth, as they must do&mdash;when the King shall
have permanently become the servant of the
Minister, and the Minister the mere agent of the
mob&mdash;when, instead of '<i>Ego et Hex mens,</i>' it shall
have become '<i>Nos</i>' without any '<i>Rex</i>' at all&mdash;when
all men shake hands over the sepulchre of their
religious prejudices and political passions&mdash;Father
Cuthbert, then will be the triumph of the Catholic
Church.  If only she knew how to use the
interval!&mdash;to be patient, never to be in a hurry&mdash;to
instil gently and unperceivedly into men's minds
the idea that all are equal, have equal rights, and
are equally right&mdash;to work very slowly and very
surely; she needs but one thing more, and that is
the man at the helm.  Let her choose the man.
He must be plausible&mdash;able to talk well&mdash;to talk
in a circle, and come to no conclusion&mdash;to throw
dust in Protestant eyes: the bigger cloud he can
raise the better.  Let him hold out openly one
hand to Protestantism, and give the other behind
his back to Rome.  When the foundation is so
laid, and the man stands at the helm&mdash;our work is
finished, Father Cuthbert.  But I doubt if any
Stuart will be reigning then&mdash;nay, I doubt if any
will reign at all."
</p>

<p>
"So much for England, then!" responded
Stevens, with a rather dubious smile.  "And
Scotland?&mdash;and Ireland?"
</p>

<p>
"Scotland!" said Gilbert, slowly.  "I am a
Scot, Father Cuthbert, though 'tis years since I
saw Scotland.  And I tell you, as a nation, we are
hard-headed and long-sighted; and we do not as a
rule take up with anything before testing it.  But
just as the sweetest-tempered man can be the most
terrible when he is angry, so, when you can throw
dust in a Scotchman's eyes, you make him blind
indeed."
</p>

<p>
"And Ireland?" repeated Stevens.
</p>

<p>
"The cause was lost there, Father, on a certain
1st of July, more than twenty years ago.  And as
yet Ireland has been rather too busy setting her
own house in order to have much leisure left to
meddle with ours."
</p>

<p>
"You forget one thing, Gilbert," said Stevens,
gravely.  "Think how many Catholic emissaries
we have in Ireland and Scotland, and how Catholic
the Gaelic heart once was, and the Erse heart has
ever been."
</p>

<p>
"Father Cuthbert, how many members of the
Society of Jesus were in Oliver Cromwell's army?"
</p>

<p>
"A good many," admitted Stevens.
</p>

<p>
"Hundreds," resumed Gilbert.[<a id="chap02fn5text"></a><a href="#chap02fn5">5</a>]  "And do you
think they did the cause any good?"
</p>

<p>
"Well, it scarce looked so at the time," said
Stephens.  "But in the end it seemed more like it."
</p>

<p>
"'Liberty' is our watchword now," said Gilbert.
"Liberty to do anything and everything: which,
of course, in six cases out of every ten, means to
do wrong.  So long as the Church is
uppermost&mdash;despotism: she can allow no liberty.  But let
the Church be undermost, and she must set
herself to obtain it by all means.  Liberty for the
sects, we ought never to forget, means liberty
for the Church.  And to the Church it is not of
much consequence whether she herself, or her
friend Liberty, devour the dying monster,
Protestantism.  When the Church sits once again on
the throne of Great Britain, the first dish served
up to her at her coronation banquet will be
the dead body of her jackal, Liberty."
</p>

<p>
"Gilbert!" said Stevens, rising from his grassy
seat, "you are not so stupid as I thought you.
Unfortunately, your talents do not lie in the
particular path which circumstances have marked
out for you.  But you have parts, Gilbert.  Let us
return to Ashcliffe."
</p>

<p>
"And go back to that dog-hole?" inquired
Gilbert, suddenly subsiding into his former
discontented self.
</p>

<p>
"I fear, my son Gilbert," said Stevens, placidly,
"that the dog-hole will have to be your habitation
for a few days longer.  But be comforted, Gilbert.
As soon as I can, I will take your place there."
</p>

<p>
"Hope you may enjoy it!" muttered Gilbert, as
they emerged on the Exeter road.
</p>

<p class="footnote">
<a id="chap02fn1"></a>
[<a href="#chap02fn1text">1</a>] Evidence of twenty-one such concealed chambers will be
found in <i>Notes and Queries</i> alone.  They exist all over England,
in old houses built between the time of Henry VIII. and that of
James II.&mdash;possibly later still.  I append the descriptions of
the two which appear to have been most cleverly concealed and
best preserved.
</p>

<p class="footnote">
The first chamber is at Ingatestone Hall, Essex, which was
anciently a grange belonging to the Abbot of Barking, and was
in possession of the Petre family from the reign of Henry
VIII. to about 1775.  "The secret chamber at Ingatestone Hall was
entered from a small room on the middle-floor, over one of the
projections of the south front.  It is a small room, attached to
what was probably the host's bedroom....  In the south-east
corner of this small room, on taking up a carpet the floor-boards
were found to be decayed.  The carpenter, on removing them,
found a second layer of boards about a foot lower down.  When
these were removed, a hole or trap about two feet square, and a
twelve-step ladder to descend into a room beneath, were
disclosed....  The use of the chamber goes back to the reign
of James I....  The hiding-place measures 14 feet in length,
2 feet 1 inch in width, and 10 feet in height.  Its floor-level is
the natural ground-line.  The floor is composed of 9 inches of
remarkably dry sand, so as to exclude damp or moisture."&mdash;<i>Notes
and Queries</i>, 1st S., xi. 437.
</p>

<p class="footnote">
The other example is at Irnham Hall, Lincolnshire.  "The
situation of this ingeniously-contrived place had been forgotten,
though it was well known to exist somewhere in the mansion,
till it was discovered a few years ago.  In going round the
chimney-stacks, it was observed that one of the chimneys of a
cluster was without any smoke or any blackness, and as clean
as when the masonry was new.  This led to the conjecture that
it was not in reality a chimney, but an open shaft to give light
and air to the priest's hiding-place; yet so forming one of a
group of chimneys as to obviate all suspicion of its real purpose.
It was carefully examined, and the conjecture fully borne out
by the discovery of the long-lost hiding-place.  The opening
into it was found by removing a beam behind a single step
between two servants' bed-rooms.  You then come to a panel
which has a very small iron tube let into it, through which any
message could be conveyed to the occupant of the hiding-place.
This panel being removed, a ladder of four steps leads down
into the secret chamber....  The hiding-place is 8 feet long
by 5 feet broad, and just high enough to allow of standing
upright."&mdash;<i>Notes and Queries</i>, 1st S., xii.
</p>

<p class="footnote">
Other instances occur at Oxburgh Hall, Norfolk; Sawston
Hall, Cambridgeshire; Coldham Hall, Suffolk; Maple Durham,
Watcomb, and Ufton Court, Berkshire; Stonyhurst and Berwick
Hall, Lancashire; Bourton, Gloucestershire; Henlip,
Worcestershire; Chelvey Court, Somerset; Nether Witton,
Northumberland; Paxhill, Sussex (built by Sir Andrew Borde, jester of
Henry VIII., and the original of "Merry Andrew"); Treago,
Hereford; Weybridge, Surrey; Woodcote, Hampshire; and
elsewhere.  In several of these instances the secret chamber
was formed in the roof of the house, and in two cases at least it
was accompanied by a small chapel.

<p>
Grand beyond expression was Madam
Passmore that Monday afternoon whereon her
party was held.  Her hair stood at the very least
six inches above her head.  Her petticoat was of
crimson quilted satin, and she wore a yellow satin
gown, edged with rich old point-lace.  Large
silver buckles decorated her shoes, and a lace
<i>cornette</i> was perched upon the summit of her hair.
A splendid fan, and a handkerchief nearly all lace,
shared her left hand; and in her pocket, alas! dwelt
a silver snuff-box.  Her four daughters
were dressed alike, in their blue satin petticoats
and brocaded trains, with coral necklaces, and
cherry-colored top-knots of ribbon instead of
<i>cornettes</i> stood on the summit of their hair.  They
also displayed fans, Isabella making all manner
of use of hers, and held handkerchiefs not quite
so elaborate as their mother's.  Their trains were
not gathered up this evening, so that when
they walked a grand display of brocade was made
on the floor.  About four o'clock, Dr. Braithwaite
and his wife made their appearance.  Mrs. Braithwaite
was a modest, retiring little woman, holding
in high reverence her big learned husband, but
the fact of being constantly kept under the sound
of quotations which she did not understand, gave
her a scared, bewildered look which did not
improve her countenance.  She was quietly
dressed in black, with lace tucker and ruffles, and
a white top-knot on her hair, which, in comparison
with that of Madam Passmore, was dressed quite low.
</p>

<p>
"Good-even, Madam, and the young ladies!"
said Mrs. Braithwaite, courtesying nervously.  "I
hope I see you well in health?"
</p>

<p>
"Madam," said the Doctor, bowing low over
the hand which Madam Passmore extended to
him, "that most marvellous and mellifluent writer
of poesy, of whom among the Grecian dramatists
the fame hath transcended"&mdash;
</p>

<p>
"Squire and Madam Harvey!" said Robert, in
a tone which drowned the Doctor's elaborate
Greek compliment.
</p>

<p>
This lady and gentleman lived in the "great
house" of the next parish.  They were quiet
people, who, having no children, had grown
somewhat prim and precise; but they had honest
and kindly hearts, and greeted their old friends, if
somewhat stiffly, yet cordially.  Squire and Madam
Rowe, Mr. John Rowe, and Mrs. Anne Rowe,
were next announced; and after a general salutation,
the party sat round the fire in high-backed
chairs, very stiff and uncomfortable.  The table in
the window held the tea-tray, and Cicely, who
entered with the tea-pot, was welcomed by all
parties, to whom she courtesied with "Hope I see
you all well, Sirs and Madams!"  Isabella, her train
trailing after her, now approached the little
table and poured out the tea.  Cicely stood holding
a waiter, on which, as each cup was filled, she
carried it in turn to the person for whom it was
intended.  Nothing was eaten with the tea.  Tea
was tea in 1710, and nothing else.

Mr. John Rowe, <i>alias</i> Johnny, was a slim youth
of eighteen, who had come to the party with the
view of making himself agreeable to Isabella.  He
would scarcely have felt flattered if he had known
how she regarded him.  She despised him
supremely, both on account of his slight juniority,
and of his taste in dress.  At this moment he wore
yellow silk stockings, green breeches, a white
waistcoat embroidered in blue, a gray silk
coat heavily laced with silver, and a very large
full-bottomed wig, of flaxen color, though his
natural hair was almost black.  As he had also
dark eyes and black eyebrows, his wig certainly
was not in the best taste.  Isabella all but
shuddered at his combination of colors as he advanced
to salute her, and did not receive him by any means
warmly&mdash;a calamity which he, poor innocent fellow,
humbly set down to his want of personal merit,
not knowing that it was caused by the deficiencies
of his costume.  Squire Passmore was nearly
as smart as his young guest, but he was dressed
with much better taste, in a dark green coat and
breeches with silver lace, white waistcoat, and
white silk stockings.  The party sat still and
sedately on their row of chairs round the
fire&mdash;Mrs. Braithwaite eclipsed and silent, for Madam
Passmore was on one side of her, in the yellow
satin, and Madam Rowe on the other, attired
in emerald green: these two ladies were talking
across her.  Further on was Madam Harvey
in dark crimson, conversing with Mrs. Anne
Rowe, who was dressed in simple white, and
Henrietta, next to Squire Rowe.  The younger
daughters of Squire Passmore were out of the
group, and so were John Rowe and Charley.  As
Celia crossed the room just behind the assembled
elders, Madam Rowe's hand detained her.
</p>

<p>
"Come and talk with me, my dear.  'Tis an age
since I saw you.  You don't grow any taller,
child!"
</p>

<p>
"I have done growing," said Celia, with a smile.
</p>

<p>
"Well, so I suppose.  How different you are
from all your sisters, to be sure!  I am sure
Mrs. Bell must be a head taller than you are."
</p>

<p>
"Not quite so much as that," said Celia, still
smiling.
</p>

<p>
"Short and sweet, Madam Rowe!" observed
Squire Harvey, who overheard her.
</p>

<p>
"Ay, I won't contradict you there," she said.
"And how old are you now, my dear?  Seventeen?"
</p>

<p>
"Nineteen, Madam."
</p>

<p>
"Dear me! well, how time does go!  To be
sure, you and your sister are just a year older
than Johnny, I remember.  You should hold
yourself up more, my dear: always make the best
of yourself.  You don't bridle so well as you
might, either.[<a id="chap03fn1text"></a><a href="#chap03fn1">1</a>]  Really, you use not all your
advantages."
</p>

<p>
"Madam Rowe, that is what I am always
telling her," said Isabella, with a faint assumption
of energy, "and she takes no more notice"&mdash;
</p>

<p>
"Well, my dear," answered Madam Rowe,
administering a dose of flattery, "you know we
cannot all be as handsome as you."
</p>

<p>
Isabella bridled, colored, and remained, though
silent, evidently not displeased.
</p>

<p>
Supper followed about six o'clock, and afterwards
the basset-table was wheeled out by Harry,
and the three Squires sat down with Dr. Braithwaite
to enjoy their favorite game.  After basset
came prayers.  As Dr. Braithwaite was present,
of course he officiated; and, casting aside
his cards, gravely took the Bible in his hand
instead of them.  A prayer followed&mdash;long, prolix,
involved, and stony: more like a sermon than a
prayer, nor a very simple sermon neither.  The
party now took their leave.  Dr. and Mrs. Braithwaite
walked to the vicarage, which was very
near.  As it was only a short distance from Ellersley
to Ashcliffe, Squire Harvey and his wife came
and returned in their coach; the distance to
Marcombe was longer, and the Rowes were on
horseback.  Harry went out and assisted the
ladies to mount, Mrs. Rowe riding behind her son,
and Anne behind her father.
</p>

<p>
"Now, Miss Lucy, my dear, come you away to
bed," said Cicely, taking sudden possession of that
personage.  "What could I have been thinking of
not to come for you before, I should like to know?
To think of you being up at this time!  A quarter
to nine, I do declare!"
</p>

<p>
"I don't know what you were thinking of, but I
wish you would think about it every night!"
answered Lucy, resigning herself to fate in the
person of Cicely.
</p>

<p>
"Well, I shall go to bed also," said Isabella,
yawning, and rising from the embroidery-frame.
"I protest I am as tired as if it were Sunday
evening!  That John Rowe is the most tedious
young man."
</p>

<p>
"You had better all go, my dears," responded
Madam Passmore.  "Good-night to you all.
Good-night, Celia."
</p>

<p>
Celia fancied that her mother repeated the
greeting to her with a tenderness in her voice
which was scarcely usual with her.  Was she
thinking of the coming revelation?
</p>

<p>
She found Cicely helping Lucy to undress.
</p>

<p>
"Cicely," she asked, sitting down, "how do you
pray?"
</p>

<p>
"Oh, that horrid Dr. Braithwaite!" cried Lucy.
"I nearly fell asleep before he had half done."
</p>

<p>
"Make haste, Miss Lucy, my dear.  You'd
ought to have been a-bed long ago.  How I pray,
Mrs. Celia?  Why, just like anybody else."
</p>

<p>
"Like Dr. Braithwaite?  Oh, me!" said Lucy,
parenthetically.
</p>

<p>
"No; not like Parson Braithwaite, my dear.
Why, I couldn't even follow Parson, he said such
hard words."
</p>

<p>
"I never tried," said Lucy, calmly.  "I'm too
sleepy to talk any more.  Good-night."  And she
composed herself on the pillow and closed her
eyes.
</p>

<p>
"You don't pray like Dr. Braithwaite, I am
sure, Cicely," said Celia.  "But how do you
pray?"
</p>

<p>
"Well, my dear, the prayers my mother taught
me, there was three on 'em&mdash;the 'Our Father,'
and the 'I Believe,' and 'Matthew, Mark, Luke,
and John.'  I says the 'Our Father' yet, and 'I
Believe' now and then; but I've left off to say
Matthew and them, for when I comes to think, it
sounds like the Papishes; and I don't see no
prayers like it in the Book neither.  I mostly
prays out of the Book now, just the words that
David did, and Moses, and the like of they;
unless I wants somewhat very particular, and then
I asks for it quite simple like, just as I'd ask you
for a drink of water if I couldn't get it for myself."
</p>

<p>
Celia lay silent and thoughtful, but "Matthew,
Mark, Luke, and John," roused Lucy in a minute.
</p>

<p>
"What's that about Matthew, Cicely?"
</p>

<p>
"Well, my dear, I'm not sure that 'tis more than
foolishness.  But my mother taught it me, and I
used to say it a many years:
</p>

<p class="poem">
  'Matthew, Mark, Luke, and John,<br />
  Bless the bed I lie upon;<br />
  Four parts around my bed,<br />
  Four angels guard my head.<br />
  I lay me down upon my side,<br />
  I pray that God my soul may guide;<br />
  And if I die before I wake,<br />
  I pray that God my soul may take.'"[<a id="chap03fn2text"></a><a href="#chap03fn2">2</a>]<br />
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
"O Cicely!" exclaimed Lucy, laughing.
</p>

<p>
"It does sound rather like praying to the apostles,
Cicely," suggested Celia; "but the end of it
is better."
</p>

<p>
"That's where it is, Mrs. Celia; and that's why
I dropped it.  Now don't you begin talking
to-night&mdash;go to sleep, there's dears.  There'll be as
many hours in to-morrow as to-day.  Eh! but, my
dear, did you ask Madam, as I said?"
</p>

<p>
"Yes, Cicely," said Celia, half-rising.  "She
will tell me to-morrow."
</p>

<p>
The troubled look in old Cicely's face deepened.
But she only said, as she took up the light, "Go to
sleep, dear hearts!"
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
"I ask your pardon, Madam!" said Cicely,
courtesying low, as Madam Passmore opened her
bedroom-door in answer to her tap.  "But could I
have a minute's speech with you, if you please?"
</p>

<p>
"Come in, Cicely, and sit down.  Is anything
the matter?"
</p>

<p>
"Well, Madam," said Cicely, glancing round
the room, as if to make quite sure there were no
listeners, "I'm afeared there's somewhat up about
Mrs. Celia.  This afternoon, as I was a-going
down the lane to Mally Rihll's, with the cordial
water and jelly you was pleased to send for sick
Robin, there was a fellow met me, that I didn't
half like the looks of.  I should know him again,
for he stopped me, and began to talk;&mdash;asked the
way to Moreton (and I doubt if he really wanted
to go, for he took the t'other turning when he
come to it), and asked whose the Park was, and if
Master was at home; and was going on to what
family he had, and such like impudent questions.
'If you want to know all that,' says I, 'you'd better
go up and ring the bell, and ask Squire his own
self,' I says.  Well, he didn't ask me no more
questions after that, but went shuffling on his way,
and took the wrong turning.  But when I got to
Mally's, and while we sat a bit, she tells me that
my gentleman had been there asking for a drink of
water, and a lot more impertinence.  And asked
her right out if there warn't a young lady at the
Park of the name of Celia, and how old she were,
and when her birthday were, and all on like that.
And Mally&mdash;(you know, Madam, she's but a simple
soul)&mdash;I could hear from her story, she up and
told him everything he asked, and maybe more
than he asked, for aught I know.  And what does
he do but (seeing, no doubt, what a simple soul
she was) outs with a table-book, and actually sets
down in black and white what she was a-telling of
him.  'The impudent rascal!' say I to Mally, when
I hears that: 'and why couldn't you have given it
him hot and strong, as I did?' I says.  And she
says he looked so like a gentleman, for all his
shabby coat, with nigh a quarter of a yard of lace
pulled off the bottom, and all a-flapping about in
the wind, as is both full and cold to-day, as she
hadn't the heart to say nothing impertinent, says
she.  But 'Impertinent!' says I; 'I think, after
all the impertinence he'd given you, you might
have give him a dose without hurting of him much,'
says I.  So I thought I'd come and tell you,
Madam, at once."
</p>

<p>
"You have done right to tell me, Cicely," said
her mistress.  "I think&mdash;I am afraid&mdash;there will
be some inquiry for the dear child, before long."
</p>

<p>
"Well, Madam, and that's what I'm afeared on,
too," said Cicely.  "And to see Mrs. Celia sitting
there so innocent like!"
</p>

<p>
"She must know, Cicely&mdash;she must know soon."
</p>

<p>
"If I was you, Madam, I'd tell her now," said
Cicely,&mdash;"asking your pardon for being so bold as
to say it to you."
</p>

<p>
"Yes, Cicely, so I shall," replied Madam
Passmore, in a very despondent tone.
</p>

<p>
"Madam," said Cicely, suddenly, "would you
be offended with me if I said a word to you?"
</p>

<p>
"My good Cicely, why should I?  Speak your mind."
</p>

<p>
"Seems to me, Madam," said Cicely, confidentially,
"as you haven't asked the Lord about this
trouble.  And though He knows all things, yet He
likes to be asked and told about 'em: He says so
somewheres.  Now, if I was you (asking your
pardon, Madam), and didn't like for to tell Mrs. Celia
(and I'm sure I shouldn't), I'd just go and tell
Him.  It'd come a sight easier, would telling her,
after that.  You see, Madam, the Lord don't put
troubles on us that He don't know nothing about.
He's tried 'em all Himself, and He knows just
where they pinches.  And when He must needs
be bring one on us, or we shall be running off
down the wrong road like so many chickens, He
whispers like with it, 'Don't be down-hearted,
child; I've tried it, and I know.'"
</p>

<p>
"Cicely, how did you come to know all this?"
inquired her mistress in astonishment.
</p>

<p>
"Bless your heart, Madam, I don't know
nothing!" humbly disclaimed Cicely,&mdash;"never did,
nor never shall.  'Tis with the Lord's lessons like
as with other lessons;&mdash;takes the like of me a
month or more to spell out a word, where there be
folks'd read it off plain.  I knows nothing, only
I knows the Lord."
</p>

<p>
Madam Passmore made no answer, but in her
secret heart she wondered, for the first time,
whether the one thing which Cicely owned to
knowing were not worth a hundredfold all the
things which she knew.
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
"Sit down, Celia, my dear.  I will now tell you
all I know."
</p>

<p>
Madam Passmore spoke rather sadly, and Celia
sat down with a beating heart.
</p>

<p>
"Celia," said her mother again, "would you like
me to tell you right at once, or by degrees?"
</p>

<p>
"At once, if you please, Mother.  Let me know
the worst."
</p>

<p>
"I am not sure that I know that, my dear,"
sighed the lady.  "However, I will say the worst
I know.  Celia! you are not my daughter."
</p>

<p>
"Mother!" was Celia's inconsistent but very
natural exclamation.
</p>

<p>
"I have told the truth," said Madam Passmore,
gently.
</p>

<p>
"But who&mdash;who are my father and mother?"
asked Celia, in a bewildered tone.
</p>

<p>
"I know not, my dear Celia.  Only you are not
our child, nor akin to us.  I will tell thee all about
it.  It was on the 10th of June, my dear, when
Bell was seven days old, nineteen years ago"&mdash;
</p>

<p>
"Is Bell not my sister, then?"
</p>

<p>
"No.  I know nought of any of thy kindred.
But hark!"
</p>

<p>
"I beg your pardon, Mother.  Please go on."
</p>

<p>
"My husband came up into my chamber, where
was only Cicely beside with the babe on her lap;
and he said, 'Lucy, my dear, there is a strange
thing happened at the Park gates.  A little babe
lies there all alone,&mdash;it would move thy motherly
heart to see it.  Shall we send and take the poor
little soul in?'  I said, 'Send Cicely to see and fetch
it.'  So Cicely brought it in&mdash;a poor, weak babe
that had scarce strength to breathe.  It was lapped
in fine white linen, laced with real point, and there
was a gold pin fastening a paper on its little coat,
with but one word&mdash;'Celia.'  Well, to be sure,
Cicely had some work to bring it round!  For
hours we feared it would die.  But at last it
seemed a little easier, and we thought it breathed
stronger.  And when my husband next came up
he said, 'Well, Lucy, shall we send the babe
away?'  But I said, 'Nay, John, it seems fairly to
ask pity from us: let us keep it, and bring it up as
our own, and call it Bell's twin-sister.  It will
never harm us&mdash;perchance bring a blessing with it,
for truly it looks as if God Almighty had sent it
to us.'  So we did that.  I do not know, my dear,
whether it was quite right of us to call you Bell's
twin-sister: I am afraid not, for certainly it is not
true.  But as to your having brought a blessing
with you, that's true enough.  But that is how it was."
</p>

<p>
Celia sat still and silent, feeling crushed and cut
off from all she loved by this disclosure.
</p>

<p>
"You have no thought," she said slowly, at last,
"who I was, nor whence I came?"
</p>

<p>
"Well, my dear, my husband thought you
might be the child of some Jacobite forced to fly,
who must needs leave you behind.  'Twas plain
you were not forsaken because your father was too
poor to keep you, for he must have been well to
do, to judge from the lace on your clothes and the
gold pin.  Mayhap some nobleman, for aught I
know."
</p>

<p>
"Mother," said Celia, with a great effort, "think
you that my parents, whosoever they were, could
be&mdash;Papists?"  The last word was scarcely more
than whispered.  It conveyed to the Passmore
mind the essence of all that was wrong, cruel, and
fearful.
</p>

<p>
"I trust not, indeed, my dear," replied Madam
Passmore, kindly, but evidently struck and
distressed by Celia's question, "for I know nought.
Now, Celia, child, don't take this to heart.
Remember thou art as much our daughter, bound to
us by every bond of love and custom, as before I
spoke a word regarding this.  There is ever a
home for thee at Ashcliffe, child; and truly I
scarce love my own better than I do thee.  Let it
not trouble thy mind.  Go and chat with Harriet
and Bell, to keep off the vapors.[<a id="chap03fn3text"></a><a href="#chap03fn3">3</a>]  Farewell, my
dear!"
</p>

<p>
Madam Passmore kissed Celia, and let her go.
She did not follow her advice to go and chat with
her sisters, but walked very slowly along the
passage which led to her own room.  She felt as if all
around her were changed, and she herself were
isolated and lost.  Heretofore the old house and
its furniture had seemed a part of herself: now
they felt as if suddenly placed at an immense
distance from her.  Even the portrait in the
passage of the Squire Passmore who had fought at
Edgehill, brandishing his sword fiercely&mdash;even the
china dragons which faced the hall-window&mdash;old
familiar objects, seemed to scowl at her as she
went by them.  She would be Celia Passmore no
longer.  At another time she would have smiled at
the superstitious fancy&mdash;only natural now&mdash;that
these disowned her as a daughter of the house.
She turned aside sadly, mechanically, into the little
room where old Cicely sat sewing and singing.
Her joint occupations ceased when she saw Celia's
face.
</p>

<p>
"Eh, my dear!  I see Madam's told you.  Come
hither and sit down a bit.  Is it very sore, dear
heart?"
</p>

<p>
"Cicely, do you know any more?" Celia asked,
without answering her question.
</p>

<p>
"I know nought more than Madam," said
Cicely.  "I went and fetched you, sweet heart,
and a nice little babe you was, though you did
keep crying, crying on for everlasting.  Such
beauties of clothes as they'd wrapped you in!  I
never see a bit of finer lace than was on them, nor
never want; and the cambric was just beautiful!
I have them laid by, if you'd like to see."
</p>

<p>
"Oh! let me see them, Cicely!  I meant to
have asked Mother."
</p>

<p>
What a mockery the last word seemed now!
</p>

<p>
Cicely unlocked one of her cupboards, and produced
the clothes, very handsome ones, as she had
said, yellow with time, and edged with rich point.
The gold pin was still there, with the paper, on
which a manly, yet delicate, Italian hand had
written the one word which alone remained to
Celia of her unknown origin.  She wondered
whether it were her father's writing.
</p>

<p>
"Cicely," she said, suddenly, "was I ever
baptized?"
</p>

<p>
"Whether afore we had you or not, Mrs. Celia,
I can't say," replied old Cicely, quietly.  "Madam
thought this here"&mdash;pointing to the paper&mdash;"meant
as you wasn't, and they'd like you to be
christened 'Celia;' and Master thought it meant
as you was christened already.  So old Parson
Herring&mdash;him as was here afore Parson Braithwaite&mdash;he
christened you in church, as it stands in
the prayer-book, 'if thou hast not been baptized,'
or what it is.  Squire thought that'd do either
way."
</p>

<p>
"And you saw nothing when you went to fetch
me, Cicely?"
</p>

<p>
"Nothing at all, my dear.  There might have
been somebody a-watching, you know&mdash;the place is
so thick with trees&mdash;but I see nought of any sort."
</p>

<p>
The long pause which followed was broken by
Cicely, who perceived that Celia's handkerchief
was coming surreptitiously into requisition.
</p>

<p>
"If I was you, Mrs. Celia, I wouldn't trouble,
my dear.  Very like nobody'll ever come after
you; and if they did, why, a grown lady like you
might sure say where you'd be&mdash;without your own
father and mother asked you; I'd never counsel
you to go again them; though it would be a sore
job parting from you, to be sure.  You see, my
dear, you've lived here nineteen years, and never
a word said."
</p>

<p>
"But that man, Cicely!" said Celia, under her
breath.
</p>

<p>
"Well, that man, my dear," repeated Cicely
doubtfully, "he's very like of no kin to you, only
somebody as knowed who you be."
</p>

<p>
"He was a Papist," said Celia, in the same tone.
"But even so, Cicely, should I make no search
for my father and mother?  I am theirs, whoever
they were; even if they were Papists."  And the
handkerchief came out openly.
</p>

<p>
"Cry it out, my dear; you'll be all the better
for it after.  And if you'll list me, Mrs. Celia,
you'll never trouble no more about this by yourself,
but just go and tell the Lord all about it.  He
knows who they be, child, and He made you their
child, knowing it.  And, my dear, I do find 'tis
no good to carry a burden to the Lord, so long as
I just get up and lift it on again.  I'm very much
given to lifting on again, Mrs. Celia, and perchance
you be.  But when I find that, why, I just go and
go again, till I can lay it down and come away
without it.  Takes a deal of going sometimes, that
do!  But what would you think of me, if I says,
'Mrs. Celia, you carry this linen up-stairs, if you
please;' and then goes and walks off with it myself?"
</p>

<p>
Old Cicely's homely illustration was just what
Celia wanted.
</p>

<p>
"Thank you, Cicely," she said; "I will try to
leave the burden behind."
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
Father Cuthbert Stevens sat in his lodging at
Moreton, complacently turning over the contents
of his portfolio.  To his landlady he had told the
same tale as to Squire Passmore, representing
himself as an artist in the employ of Sir Godfrey
Kneller; and had, to her thinking, verified his
story beyond all doubt, by producing in part-payment
of his debt a new shop-sign, representing a
very fat and amiable-looking lion, standing on one
leg, the other three paws flourishing in the air,
while the eyes of the quadruped were fixed on the
spectator.  Mrs. Smith considered it a marvellous
work of art, and cut off a large slice of Mr. Stevens'
bill accordingly.  Mr. Stevens passed his sketches
slowly in review, tearing up the greater part, and
committing them to the safe custody of the fire.
But when he came to the staircase at Ashcliffe,
he quietly placed that in security in a special
pocket of the portfolio.  He was too wise to speak
his thoughts aloud; but had he done so he would
have said:
</p>

<p>
"I have not done with this yet.  To-morrow
I propose to pay a visit to Marcombe, and this
will secure me an unsuspected entrance into
Mr. Rowe's family, where I may obtain some
further information, on which a little paper and
lead will be well spent."
</p>

<p>
Gilbert Irvine had rather remonstrated on Stevens'
telling the same tale to Mrs. Smith as to the
Squire at Ashcliffe, reminding him that it was
well to have two strings to one's bow.  Stevens
answered, with that calm confidence in his own
wisdom which never forsook him, "It is sometimes
desirable, my good Gilbert, not to have too
many strings to one's bow.  This is my official
residence.  Mr. Passmore, or some other country
gentleman, may find that I am lodging here.
What do I gain, in that case, by representing myself
to this excellent woman as a retired sea-captain
or an officer on leave of absence?  No; I am
an artist at Ashcliffe, and I am an artist at
Moreton.  My private residence is&mdash;&mdash;elsewhere.
I am a citizen of the world.  I am not troubled by
any inconvenient attachment to country or home.
I can sleep on a feather-bed, a green bank, or a
deal board; I can eat black bread as well as <i>pâté
aux truffes</i>."
</p>

<p>
"Ah! but can you do without either?" growled
Gilbert, in reply.
</p>

<p>
To return from this episode.  Mr. Stevens was
now alone, having, as we saw, parted with Gilbert
that afternoon, the latter returning to the
hiding-place at Ashcliffe, very much against his
inclination.  The former worthy gentleman had supped
on a hashed partridge, obtained in an
unsportsmanlike manner which would have disgusted
Squire Passmore; for while Stevens could talk
glibly against poaching or anything else, when he
required a savory dish, he was not above setting
a snare on his own account.  He had just placed
safely in the pocket of the portfolio such sketches
as he deemed it politic to retain, when a slight
noise at the door attracted his attention, and
looking up, he saw Gilbert Irvine, with white face
and dilated eyes, standing in the doorway.
</p>

<p>
"We are betrayed!" hissed the latter.
</p>

<p>
Mr. Stevens, rising, quietly closed the door
behind Gilbert, and set a chair for his excited
visitor.
</p>

<p>
"Don't be rash, Gilbert," observed he, calmly
tying the strings of the portfolio.
</p>

<p>
"Bash!" muttered Gilbert, between his closed
teeth.  "I tell you, they have discovered the
hiding-place!"
</p>

<p>
"Have they?  Then it was fortunate that I
thought of dining to-day with Mr. Passmore."
</p>

<p>
"Father Cuthbert, do you care for nothing on
earth?" said Gilbert, raising his voice.
</p>

<p>
"Gilbert," remarked Mr. Stevens, in his most
placid manner, "I have already desired you not
to be too rash.  Allow me to remind you, that
calling me 'Father Cuthbert' in a Protestant
house, and especially in that tone of voice, is
scarce likely to advance our interests.  As to
my caring for nothing on earth, I shall care to
hear your information, when you can deliver
yourself of it in a reasonable manner."
</p>

<p>
Gilbert, with some difficulty repressing his
indignation, came to the conclusion that the being
before him was inaccessible to feeling.
</p>

<p>
"When I arrived at the well," said he, "I was
very near falling into it.  I"&mdash;
</p>

<p>
"Ah! rash, as usual," commented Stevens,
affectionately patting the portfolio.
</p>

<p>
"I lighted safely on the ledge of the door,"
pursued Gilbert, "but when I gave the necessary
push, I found that it refused to stir.  It had been
made up from the inside."
</p>

<p>
"Something underneath the door, which stuck,
of course," said Stevens.
</p>

<p>
"I took out my knife," replied Gilbert, "and
with great difficulty steadied myself so that I
could pass the blade under the door.  There was
nothing underneath, but the door refused to stir."
</p>

<p>
"What did you do then?"
</p>

<p>
"Came back to you directly, to ask you whether
we ought to leave the country."
</p>

<p>
"You did not try at the other end?"
</p>

<p>
"In broad daylight?  Mr. Stevens, what can
you be thinking of?"
</p>

<p>
"The interests of the cause, my friend."
</p>

<p>
"Ah, well!  I have the greatest respect for the
interests of the cause, but I have also a slight
disposition to attend to the interests of Gilbert
Irvine."
</p>

<p>
"That is precisely your bane, my excellent Gilbert.
And there are other defects in you beside."
</p>

<p>
"And pray, what excuse could you have
devised to gain entrance?"
</p>

<p>
"Gilbert, I wonder at your marvellous incapacity
for lying.  Now it comes quite natural to me."
</p>

<p>
"Seems so," said Gilbert, grimly.
</p>

<p>
"Well, as your disposition to attend to the
interests of Gilbert Irvine is so strong, I will not
require more of you than to attempt the entrance
by night.  I noticed when I left the house that
one of the drawing-room windows was unfastened.
You can get in that way, and pass through
Mrs. Celia's chamber."
</p>

<p>
"I'm blessed if I'll try that style of putting my
neck in a noose for you more than this once!" Gilbert
burst forth.
</p>

<p>
"I don't ask it of you more than this once,"
replied Stevens.
</p>

<p>
"And suppose they have fastened the window
since you were there, as is probably the case?"
</p>

<p>
"If you cannot get in, come back to me.  We
must find out whether they have discovered the
hiding-place.  But I will take the next chance
myself; and, Gilbert, it shall be in broad daylight."
</p>

<p>
Gilbert stared at him, and shook his head with
an incredulous laugh.
</p>

<p>
"You are a poor conspirator, Gilbert," lamented
Stevens.  "Can you plaster a wall?"
</p>

<p>
"No," said Gilbert.
</p>

<p>
"I can.  Can you mend a harpsichord?"
</p>

<p>
"Not I, indeed."
</p>

<p>
"I can.  And can you make a tansy pudding?"
</p>

<p>
"Holy Mary! such women's work!"
</p>

<p>
"Women are useful, my friend, in their
way&mdash;occasionally.  And it is desirable, now and then,
even for the nobler sex, to know how to do
women's work.  Now I dare say you have not the
least notion how a shirt is made?  I can sew
beautifully."
</p>

<p>
"By the head of St. Barbara!"&mdash;Gilbert began.
</p>

<p>
"Avoid Catholic oaths, Gilbert, if you please.
And never be above learning.  Pick up all you
can&mdash;no matter what.  It may come in use some time."
</p>

<p>
"I wish you would tell me how you mean to get in?"
</p>

<p>
"Mr. Passmore was observing at dinner that he
wanted a new under-footman.  I shall offer myself
for the place."
</p>

<p>
Gilbert's eyes and mouth opened rather wide.
</p>

<p>
"I can carry coal-scuttles, my friend," said
Mr. Cuthbert Stevens, insinuatingly.  "And I could
black a boot.  In a week (or as soon as my purpose
was served) I should have a bad cough, find
that the work was too hard for me, and leave."
</p>

<p>
"Father Cuthbert, you are a clever fellow!" said
Gilbert, slowly.
</p>

<p>
Father Cuthbert made no attempt to deny the
impeachment.
</p>

<p>
"And where am I to be, while you are blacking
your boots and carrying your coal-scuttles?"
</p>

<p>
"Quietly pursuing your inquiries between here
and Exeter, and keeping out of scrapes&mdash;if you
can.  You will find me here again this day
month."
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
On the evening of the next day, Squire Passmore
saw and engaged a new under-footman.
</p>

<p>
"A tall, personable fellow," said he to his
family; "very well-spoken, and capable, he seems.
He comes from Exeter, and his name is George
Shepherd."
</p>

<p>
And much vexed was he, for he had taken a
fancy to his new servant, when, four days later,
Robert announced to him that George had such a
bad cough, and found the work so hard for his
weak chest, that he wished to leave at the end of
the month.
</p>

<p>
"It ben't always the strongest-looking as is the
strongest," observed Cicely on the subject; "and
I'm a-feared, Madam, that George is but weakly,
for all he looks so capable."
</p>

<p>
Madam Passmore, who felt very sorry for poor
George, tried diet-drinks, linseed tea, and lozenges,
but all were to no purpose; and at the end of the
month the new footman left.
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
"What <i>are</i> you doing, Mr. Stevens?" demanded
Gilbert Irvine, as he entered the lodger's room at
Moreton on the same evening that the under-footman's
place at Ashcliffe Hull was again left vacant.
</p>

<p>
"Good-evening, Gilbert," responded Mr. Stevens,
without looking up.  "Only making my
official shirts into a rather smaller and neater
bundle.  They may serve again, you know."
</p>

<p>
"And what news?" asked Gilbert.
</p>

<p>
"You were right," said Mr. Stevens.  "They
have found it out, and have made up the well-door.
But Mrs. Celia knows nothing about the hiding-place,
though she sleeps in the chamber."
</p>

<p>
"Well, and why couldn't you believe me at first?
What have you gained by all your trouble?"
</p>

<p>
"Why could I not believe you?" repeated
Stevens.  "Because you are rash, as I always tell
you.  And what have I gained?  A month's board
and lodging, and thirteen and fourpence.  Look at it."
</p>

<p>
"Ugh!" said Gilbert to the shillings.  "Well, I
would not have blacked a lot of dirty boots for
you, if you'd been twice as many!"
</p>

<p>
"A mistake, Gilbert! a sad mistake!" said Stevens,
tying up his bundle.  "Never be above doing
anything for the good of the Church."
</p>

<p>
"Nor telling any number of lies," responded
Gilbert.  "Well, and where are we to go now?"
</p>

<p>
"Back to France, and report to my Lady Ingram
as quickly as possible."
</p>

<p>
"And what then?"
</p>

<p>
"That is for her to say.  I should think she will
come and fetch the girl."
</p>

<p>
"And how are we to live meanwhile?"
</p>

<p>
"You, as you please.  For me, being now so
well equipped and in good practice," answered
Mr. Cuthbert Stevens, with an insinuating smile,
"if I found it impossible to get any other sort of
work, I <i>could</i> take another place as footman!"
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
Time passed calmly on for some months after
Madam Passmore's disclosure to Celia.  The latter
gradually lost the fear of being claimed by strangers,
and devoted herself to the very diligent study
of the Scriptures.  The Squire and Madam Passmore
became slowly grayer, and Cicely Aggett a
little whiter than before.  But nothing occurred to
break the quiet tenor of events, until Henrietta's
marriage took place in the summer of 1711.  The
bridegroom was the heir of a family living in the
adjoining division of the county, and the day was
marked at Ashcliffe by much splendor and festivity.
The bride showed herself quiet and practical on
this occasion, as on all others; and as she had
made her mark but little, she was comparatively
little missed.  Cicely cried because she thought it
was the first break in the family, and Dolly
because she fancied it was the proper thing to do;
but Henrietta herself would have scorned to run
the risk of spoiling her primrose silk by tears.
Everything was done <i>en règle</i>&mdash;wedding and
breakfast, throwing the slipper, dancing, and a number
of other small observances which have since been
counted tedious or unseemly.  And when the day
was over, and Henrietta Carey had departed to
her new home, things sank down into their old
groove at Ashcliffe Hall.
</p>

<p>
When the year 1712 dawned, only the three
younger sisters of the family were at home.  Harry
had rejoined his regiment, and Charley was away
on a visit to his eldest sister and her husband.
</p>

<p>
So matters stood at Ashcliffe Hall on that New
Year's Day when what Celia dreaded came upon
her.

  "She had the low voice of your English dames,<br />

<p>
The Tories were in power in the winter of
1711-12.  The Duke of Marlborough's credit at
home had long been sinking, and he was now
almost at the lowest point in the Queen's favor.
On that very New Year's Day of which I have
spoken, for the first time in the annals of England,
a Ministry had endeavored to swamp the House of
Lords by a wholesale creation of Peers.  Politically
speaking, Squire Passmore was anything but
happy, for he was a fervent Whig.  He sat in the
parlor that morning, inveighing angrily against the
Earl of Oxford and all who followed or agreed with
him&mdash;the Queen herself of course excepted&mdash;for
the edification of Madam Passmore&mdash;who was
calmly knotting&mdash;Isabella, and Celia.
</p>

<p>
"'Tis pity, John," said Madam Passmore,
quietly, "that you have no Tories to list you."
</p>

<p>
"I wish I had&mdash;the scoundrels!" exclaimed the Squire.
</p>

<p>
"O Mother!" cried Isabella, rising hurriedly
from her seat in the window, "sure here is some
visitor of quality.  There is a carriage at the front
door with arms on the panels."
</p>

<p>
"What arms?" asked her father.
</p>

<p>
"I don't understand anything about arms," said
Isabella, "and one of the coats I cannot see rightly.
The one nearer here is all cut up into little squares,
and in one part there is a dog on his hind legs, and
in another a pair of yellow balls."
</p>

<p>
The Squire came to the window to see for himself.
"Dog! balls!" cried he.  "A lion rampant
and bezants&mdash;the goose!"
</p>

<p>
"Well, Father, I told you I did not understand
it!" remonstrated Isabella, in an injured tone.
</p>

<p>
"Madam, my Lady Ingram!" announced Robert,
in a voice of great importance.
</p>

<p>
The Squire turned round directly, and offered
his hand to conduct the visitor to a seat, like a
well-bred gentleman of his day,&mdash;Madam Passmore
rising to receive her, and her daughters of course
following her example.
</p>

<p>
The stranger was a tall, commanding woman,
with great stateliness of carriage, and much
languor of manner.  She had evidently been very
handsome, but was now just past her prime.  Her
eyes and hair were dark, her voice low and
languishing.  Altogether it struck Celia that she was
very like what Isabella would be in a few years,
allowing for the differences in color.  She took the
chair to which the Squire led her, and addressed
herself to Madam Passmore.  There was a little
peculiarity of distinctness in her pronunciation.
</p>

<p>
"You wonder to see me, Madam," she began.
</p>

<p>
"Madam, I am honored by your Ladyship's visit."
</p>

<p>
"I am the widow of Sir Edward Ingram, who
held a commission under His Majesty King James.
I come to speak with you on business."
</p>

<p>
"With <i>me</i>?" asked Madam Passmore, a little surprised.
</p>

<p>
"You are Madam Passmore, of Ashcliffe Hall?&mdash;Yes."
</p>

<p>
"Pray continue, Madam."
</p>

<p>
"Your daughters, Madam?" inquired the visitor,
with a languid wave of her hand towards the young
ladies.
</p>

<p>
"Yes; does your Ladyship wish to see me without them?"
</p>

<p>
"Not at all&mdash;oh! not at all.  Which is Mademoiselle Celia?"
</p>

<p>
"The woman's French!" exclaimed the Squire,
under his breath.
</p>

<p>
Celia's blood rushed to her face and neck, and
then ebbed, leaving her white and faint, as she
rose and came slowly forward.  "Is this my
mother?" she was asking herself, in a mental
tumult.
</p>

<p>
"Ah! that is you?  Stand a little farther, if you
please.  I wish to look at you."
</p>

<p>
"No; this is not my mother!" said Celia, to her
own heart.
</p>

<p>
"Not by the half so tall as I should like&mdash;quite
<i>petite</i>!" said Lady Ingram, scanning Celia with a
depreciatory air.  "And so brown!  You cannot
bridle&mdash;you have no complexion.  Eh! <i>ma foi!</i> what
an English-looking girl!"
</p>

<p>
The Squire had almost arrived at the end of his
patience.  Madam Passmore said quietly, "I ask
your Ladyship's pardon, but perhaps you will
tell me why you make these remarks on my
daughter?"
</p>

<p>
"I beg yours," said Lady Ingram, languidly.  "I
thought I had told you.  She is a foundling?&mdash;Exactly.
<i>Et bien</i>, she is my daughter&mdash;that is, my
husband's daughter."
</p>

<p>
"Thank Heaven, not yours!" growled the Squire,
heard only by Isabella.
</p>

<p>
"My husband was married twice," pursued the
visitor, unconscious of his rising anger.  "His first
wife was an Englishwoman&mdash;short, I suppose, and
brown, like this girl.  I am the second wife, <i>née</i>
Mademoiselle de La Croix, daughter of Monsieur
the Marquis de La Croix.  <i>Tu peux m'embrasser
ma fille</i>."
</p>

<p>
Celia would have obeyed somewhat reluctantly,
had she understood her step-mother.  She stood
still, unaware that she had been addressed at all,
since she had never learned the language in which
Lady Ingram had spoken to her.
</p>

<p>
"Well, you will not?"
</p>

<p>
"I beg your pardon, Madam," answered Celia,
speaking for the first time, and in a very tremulous
voice.  "I did not understand what you said."
</p>

<p>
"You speak French?"
</p>

<p>
"No, Madam."
</p>

<p>
"<i>Possible!</i>" exclaimed Lady Ingram.  "You
have never taught her to speak French?  She
speaks only English?  <i>Ma foi, quelle famille!</i>"
</p>

<p>
"I could scarce teach her what I knew not,"
replied Madam Passmore, with quiet dignity.
</p>

<p>
"<i>C'est incroyable!</i>" drawled Lady Ingram,
"Well, child, come here and kiss me.  How
awkwardly you stoop!  Your carriage is bad&mdash;very
bad.  Ah, well!  I shall see to all that.  You will
be ready to return with me on Thursday?"
</p>

<p>
This was only Tuesday.  Celia heard the question
put with a sinking of dismay.  How should
she go? yet how should she refuse?
</p>

<p>
"My Lady Ingram," said Squire Passmore,
coming forward at last, "if you were this child's
own mother, or if her father were yet alive, I could
not of course set myself against your taking her
away.  But you tell us that you are only her
step-mother, and that her father is dead.  It seems to
me, therefore, that she is at least as much our child
as yours&mdash;rather more, indeed, seeing that we have
brought her up from her cradle, and you have
never cared to see her until this day.  Moreover,
I hope your Ladyship will not take it ill of me, if I
ask you for some proof that you really are the
child's step-mother."
</p>

<p>
"What proof shall I give you, Mr. Passmore?"
asked Lady Ingram, quietly.  "I have every wish
to satisfy you.  If you desire to see proofs that I
am really Lady Ingram, ask the servants my name,
or look here"&mdash;
</p>

<p>
She drew a letter from her pocket, and held it
out to the Squire.  The direction was&mdash;"To my
Lady Ingram."
</p>

<p>
"Madam," said the Squire, returning the letter
with a bow, "I do not in the least doubt that I
have the honor of addressing my Lady Ingram.
But can you satisfy me that you are Celia's
step-mother?"
</p>

<p>
"If my word is not enough to satisfy you,
Mr. Passmore," answered Lady Ingram, not at all
annoyed, "I know of nothing that will do it.  The
marriage-registers of Celia's parents, or my own,
would give you no information concerning her:
and she has no register of baptism.  I believe,
however, that her name was written on a paper
left with her, in Sir Edward's hand.  If you will
produce that paper, I will show you more of his
writing, which you can compare with it.  I think
the fact of my knowledge on the subject ought to
prove to you that I am the person whom I represent
myself to be."
</p>

<p>
The writing on the two papers, when compared,
tallied; and Squire Passmore felt that Lady
Ingram was right, and that she could not produce
any proof of her relationship so strong as the mere
fact of her knowledge of Celia's name and origin.
If she really were Celia's step-mother, he had no
wish to prevent his adopted daughter from making
acquaintance with her own family: and he saw
nothing for it but to take Lady Ingram at her word.
</p>

<p>
"I am satisfied, Madam, that you have some
relation to Celia," said he.  "And as to her visiting
you&mdash;for I cannot consent to her being taken
entirely away&mdash;let the child choose for herself.
Sure she is old enough."
</p>

<p>
"Ah!" said Lady Ingram, shrugging her shoulders
slightly.  "Very well.  You shall decide,
<i>chère</i> Celia.  At the least you will visit me?"
</p>

<p>
"I will visit you, Madam, with pleasure,"
answered Celia, a little to the damage of truth; "but
these dear friends, who have had a care of me
from my childhood, I could not leave them entirely,
Madam."  The sentence ended in tears.
</p>

<p>
"I am not an officer of justice, <i>ma belle</i>!" said
Lady Ingram, laughing faintly.  "Ah, well! a visit
let it be.  You will come with me&mdash;for a visit&mdash;on
Thursday?"
</p>

<p>
"I will attend your Ladyship."
</p>

<p>
"You live near, Madam?" asked Madam Passmore,
wondering whether she could live so far
away as the next county.
</p>

<p>
"I live in France," was the unconcerned answer,&mdash;"in
Paris in the winter, and not far thence
in the summer."
</p>

<p>
The Squire almost gasped for breath.  "And
where is your summer dwelling, Madam?  I think,
if you please, that I have a right to ask."
</p>

<p>
"Oh! certainly.  At St. Germain-en-Laye."
</p>

<p>
"St. fiddlesticks-and-fiddlestrings!" roared the
Squire.
</p>

<p>
"Sir!" observed Lady Ingram, apparently a
little startled at last.
</p>

<p>
"Pope, Pretender, and Devil!" thundered the
exasperated Whig.
</p>

<p>
"Ah!  I only know one of the three," said Lady
Ingram, subsiding.
</p>

<p>
"And pray which is that, Madam?" grimly inquired he.
</p>

<p>
"<i>Le Roi Jacques</i>&mdash;you call the Pretender," said
she calmly, drawing on her glove.
</p>

<p>
"If you please, Madam," asked Celia, with an
effort, "do you know what was my mother's
name?"
</p>

<p>
"White, Black&mdash;some color&mdash;I know not
whether Red, Green, or Blue.  She was a nobody&mdash;a
mere nobody," replied her successor, dismissing
Celia's insignificant mother with a graceful
wave of her hands.
</p>

<p>
"Have I any brothers or sisters, Madam?"
</p>

<p>
"Sisters! no.  Two brothers&mdash;one son of your
mother, and one of mine."
</p>

<p>
"They live with you, Madam?"
</p>

<p>
"My son Philip does," said the Baronet's
widow.  "Your brother&mdash;Sir Edward now&mdash;is
away on his travels, the saints know where.  But
he talked to me much about you before he went,
and Philip teased me about you&mdash;so I came."
</p>

<p>
"Celia!" said the Squire, sternly, "this woman
is an alien, a Tory, and a Papist.  Will you still
go?"
</p>

<p>
"Ought I not, Father?" she asked, in a low tone.
</p>

<p>
"Judge for yourself, child," he answered, kindly.
</p>

<p>
"I think I ought to go," said Celia, faintly.
</p>

<p>
"I am a Catholic, Mr. Passmore, it is true,"
remarked Lady Ingram, quietly; "yet you need not
fear me.  Sir Edward, my husband, was Protestant,
and so is his son Edward: and I do not interfere.
We are all surely going to heaven, and
what matter for the different roads?"
</p>

<p>
"I think I ought to go," repeated Celia, but
Madam Passmore thought, still more faintly than
before.
</p>

<p>
"On Thursday, then," answered Lady Ingram,
touching Celia's cheek with her lips.  "Ah! <i>ma
chère</i>, how I will improve you when I have you to
myself!&mdash;how I will form you!  That <i>bon ton</i>,
that <i>aisance</i>, that <i>maintien!</i>&mdash;you have them not.
You shall soon!  Adieu!"
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
"Well, sure, 'tis sore to lose you, Mrs. Celia, my
dear!" observed Cicely Aggett, as she sat sewing;
"but more particular to a stranger&mdash;among them
dreadful Papists&mdash;and such a way off, too!  Why,
'tis nigh a hundred mile from here to Paris, ben't it?"
</p>

<p>
"I don't know how far it is," said Celia,
honestly; "but I am sure 'tis a very long way."
</p>

<p>
"Well, anyhow, you'll not forget us, dear heart?"
</p>

<p>
"I shall never do that, Cicely.  But don't talk
as if I were going away altogether.  'Tis only a
visit.  I shall soon come back&mdash;in a year, at the
longest."
</p>

<p>
"Maybe, my dear," answered Cicely, quietly;
"and maybe not, Mrs. Celia.  A year is a long
time, and we none of us know what the Lord may
have for us afore then.  Not one of us a-going
along with you!  Well, you'll have Him with you,
and He'll see to you a deal better than we could.
But to think of you going among them wicked,
cruel Papists!  Don't have no more to do with
none of them than you can help&mdash;don't, my dear!
Depend upon it, Mrs. Celia, they ben't a bit
better now than they was a hundred and fifty
years ago, when they burned and tormented poor
folks all over the country, as my grandmother
used to tell me."
</p>

<p>
"What did she tell you about it, Cicely?"
</p>

<p>
"She were to Exeter,[<a id="chap04fn1atext"></a><a href="#chap04fn1a">1a</a>] Mrs. Celia, and she lived
till I was a matter of fifteen; and many a tale she's
told me of their doings in them old times.  But
the one I always liked best was one her mother
had told her.  Her mother had been a young
maid when the burnings was a-going on; she were
to London,[<a id="chap04fn1btext"></a><a href="#chap04fn1b">1b</a>] and was woman to a lady, one of them
as was burnt."
</p>

<p>
"Tell me about it, Cicely," requested Celia, with
feelings of curiosity and horror struggling for
precedence.
</p>

<p>
"I'll tell you all I know about it, my dear.
There! your ruffles is done.  I'll take Mrs. Bell's
next.  Well, Mrs. Celia, her name, my
great-grandmother's mistress, was Kyme; she was to
Lincolnshire, leastwise her husband, for she was a
London lady herself.  An old family them Kymes
be; they've dwelt in Lincolnshire ever since Moses,
for aught I know.  Mrs. Anne&mdash;that was her
name&mdash;was a sweet, gentle lady; but her husband,
Mr. Kyme, wasn't so likely: he'd a cruel rare
temper, I've heard my grandmother say.  Well,
and after a while Mr. Kyme he came to use
Mrs. Anne so hard, she couldn't live with him no
longer, and she came back to her father and
mother.  She never went back to Lincolnshire;
she took back her own name, and everybody
called her Mrs. Anne Askew, instead of Madam
Kyme.  I never understood quite the rights of it,
and I'm not sure my grandmother did herself; but
however, some way Mrs. Anne she got hold
of a Bible, and she fell a-reading it.  And of
course she couldn't but see with half an eye, when
she come to read, that all them Papishes had
taught her was all wrong, when she didn't find not
one of their foolishnesses set down in the book.
And by and by the priests came to hear of it.  I
don't just know how that were; I think somebody
betrayed her, but I can't tell who: not my
great-grandmother, I'm sure, for she held her
lady dear.  Ay, but there was a scrimmage when
they knowed!  Poor young lady! all turned
against her, her own father and mother and all
and the priests had their wicked will.  They
took her to Newgate, and tried first to talk
her over; but when they found their talk was
no good, but Mrs. Anne she held fast by what
God had taught her, they had her into the
torture-chamber."
</p>

<p>
Celia drew a long breath.
</p>

<p>
"Ah!" said old Cicely, slowly shaking her white
head, "'tis easy to say 'God forgive them!'
but truly I misdoubt whether God <i>can</i> forgive
them that tear the flesh and rent the hearts
of His saints!  What they did to that poor young
thing in that torture-chamber, God knoweth.  I
make no doubt 'tis all writ down in His book.
But Mrs. Anne she stood firm, and not one word
could they get out of her; and my Lord Chancellor,
who was there, he was so mad angry with her,
that he throwed off his gown and pulled the rack
with his own hands.  At last the doctors said&mdash;for
they had doctors there, the devils! to tell them
how much the poor wretches could bear&mdash;the
doctors said that if Mrs. Anne had any more, she
would be like to die under it.  So then they took
her down; but afore they let her be, they kept her
two hours longer a-sitting on the bare floor,
and my Lord Chancellor a-talking at her all that
ever he could.  Then at last, when they found
her too much for them, they took her away
and laid her to bed.  'As weary and painful
bones,' quoth she to my great-grandmother, 'had
I as ever had patient Job.  I thank my Lord God
therefor!'[<a id="chap04fn2text"></a><a href="#chap04fn2">2</a>]  And if that warn't a good Christian
saying, my dear, I'd like to hear one.  Well,
for some months after that she laid in prison; the
wicked priests for ever at her, wearying her
life out with talk and such.  So at the end of all,
when they saw it was no good, they carried
her out to Smithfield, there to die.
</p>

<p>
"They carried her out, really; for every bone in
her was broken, and if she had lived fifty years
after, she could never have set her foot to the
ground again.  But Mrs. Anne she went smiling,
and they said which saw her, as joyful as if
she were going to her bridal.  There, at the stake,
with the faggots round, they offered her, last
thing, a pardon if she would come round to
their evil ways.  Ah! they knew not the strength
within her! they saw not the angels waiting round,
when that poor broken body should be ashes, to
take up the glad soul to the Lord's rest.  What
was pardon to her, poor crushed thing?  She had
seen too much of the glory of the Lord to set any
price on their pardons.  So when they could
do nought more with her, they burned her to ashes
at the stake."
</p>

<p>
Old Cicely added no comment.  Was any
needed?  But if she had known the words spoken
at one such holocaust by the mother of the
martyr, she might fitly have ended her tale
with them:
</p>

<p>
"BLESSED BE JESUS CHRIST, AND HIS WITNESSES!"
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
"<i>Bon jour, ma chère</i>.  You look a little better
this morning&mdash;not quite so English.  <i>Et bien!</i> you
are ready to come?"
</p>

<p>
Celia had never felt so English as at that
moment.  She forced back the tears, which felt as if
they would work their way out in spite of her, and
said, in a very low voice, "I am ready, Madam."
</p>

<p>
"Let us lose no time, then," said Lady Ingram,
rising, and allowing her hoop to spread itself out
to its full width.  "I wish you a <i>very</i> good morning,
Madam."
</p>

<p>
She swept slowly and statelily across the room,
leaving Celia to exchange passionate kisses with all
the members of the family, and then, almost
blinded by the tears which would come at last, to
make her way to the coach which was standing at
the door.
</p>

<p>
"There, there, my dear!" said Lady Ingram, a
little querulously, when the coach had been
travelling about five minutes; "that is quite enough.
You will make your eyes red.  There is nothing,
absolutely nothing, so unbecoming as the red eyes.
These people are not your family&mdash;not at all so
good.  I do not see anything to cry about."
</p>

<p>
"She does not mean to be unkind," thought
Celia to herself.  "She is only heartless."
</p>

<p>
True&mdash;but what an <i>only</i>!
</p>

<p>
Lady Ingram, having done her duty to her
step-daughter, leaned back in the coach and
closed her eyes.  She opened them again for a
moment, and said, "We arrive on Tuesday in London,
I start for Paris not until the next Tuesday."  Then
the dark languishing eyes shut again, rather
to Celia's relief.  The ponderous vehicle worked
its way slowly along the muddy roads.  Celia sat
by her step-mother, and opposite was Lady
Ingram's maid, a dark-browed Frenchwoman; both
were remarkably silent.  Lady Ingram went to
sleep, and the maid sat upright, stony, and
passive, frequently scanning the young stranger with
her black eyes, but never uttering a word.  That
evening the coach clattered into Chard, where
they slept.  The Friday saw them at Shaftesbury,
the Saturday night at Andover, where they put up
for the Sunday.  On the Monday evening they
reached Bagshot, Lady Ingram declaring that she
must have the morning to pass Bagshot Heath,
and adding a few anecdotes of her past troubles
with highwaymen which terrified Celia.  Two
men travelling on horseback, who were staying at
the inn, joined their forces to the carriage, and the
heath was passed without any attack from the
highwaymen.  About ten o'clock, when they were
a little past the heath, Lady Ingram desired Celia
to keep her eyes open.  "We are just entering
Windsor," she said; "and though I have not time
to stop and let you see the Castle, yet you may
perhaps get a glimpse of it as we pass."  They
passed the Castle, and drove down the park.
Suddenly the coach came to a full stop.
</p>

<p>
"The stupid man!" exclaimed Lady Ingram.
"What does he?"
</p>

<p>
The question was very soon answered, for
William, the footman, sprang from his perch, and
presented himself at the carriage-window.  Lady
Ingram let down the glass.
</p>

<p>
"What is the matter?" she asked, testily.
</p>

<p>
"If you please, Madam," was the answer,
"there is a coach coming with gentlemen on horseback,
and two running footmen in attendance; and
Shale thinks it must be the Queen's."
</p>

<p>
"Draw to one side immediately," commanded
Lady Ingram, "and then open the door and we
will alight."
</p>

<p>
All alighted except the coachman, and Lady Ingram
took Celia's hand, and stood with her just in
front of her carriage.  The running footmen passed
them first, carrying long wands, and dressed in
scarlet and gold livery.  Lady Ingram's practised
eye detected at once that the liveries were royal.
Then came three gentlemen, two riding in front,
the third behind.  The coach, a large, handsome,
but very unwieldly vehicle, lumbered slowly after
them.  In it were seated three ladies&mdash;one alone
facing the horses, the others on the opposite seat.
</p>

<p>
"Which is the Queen, Madam?" asked Celia, excitedly.
</p>

<p>
"The Princess Anne will sit alone, facing the
horses," replied her step-mother.
</p>

<p>
The lady who occupied the seat of honor, and
whom alone Celia noticed, was the fattest woman
she had ever seen.  She had a fat, round face, and
ruddy complexion, dark chestnut hair, and regular
features.  Her eyes were gray, and the expression
of her face, though kindly, was not indicative of
either liveliness or intellect.  She wore a black
dress trimmed with ermine, and a long black hood
lined with the same fur.  Not until the Queen had
become invisible to her did Celia notice her ladies
on the opposite seat.  One of them was remarkable
for a nose not extremely beautiful, and abundance
of curls of a dusky red streamed over her
shoulders.  Celia glanced at the other, and came
to the conclusion that there was nothing particular
about her.
</p>

<p>
"So that is Abigail Hill!"[<a id="chap04fn3text"></a><a href="#chap04fn3">3</a>] said Lady Ingram,
in a peculiar tone, when the coach had driven
past.  "I thought she had had more in her&mdash;at
least to look at."
</p>

<p>
"Is that the lady with the red hair, Madam?"
</p>

<p>
"No, my dear&mdash;the other.  The red-haired one
is the Duchess of Somerset."[<a id="chap04fn4text"></a><a href="#chap04fn4">4</a>]
</p>

<p>
Lady Ingram still stood looking after the royal
carriage with a meditative air.
</p>

<p>
"I should like to see Abigail Hill," she said, as
if to herself.  "I cannot tell how to do it.  But
we must not delay, even for that.  Get in, my dear."
</p>

<p>
Celia got into the coach, wondering what reason
her step-mother could have for wishing to see
Lady Masham, and also why she did not give her
the benefit of her title.  Lady Ingram resumed
her own seat in silence, and leaned back in the
carriage, apparently cogitating deeply.  Mile after
mile the travellers journeyed on, until the dusk
fell, and at the little inn at Bedfont the coach
pulled up.  William appeared at the window.
</p>

<p>
"Please your Ladyship, we can cross the heath
to-night," he said.  "There's a regiment of
Colonel Churchill's just before: the host says they
haven't been gone five minutes."
</p>

<p>
"Then bid Shale hasten on, without stopping to
bait," answered his mistress.  "We must overtake
them, for I do not mean to stop on the road
another night, unless it cannot be helped."
</p>

<p>
The horses were urged on as fast as they could
go, and in about a quarter of an hour they came
up with the regiment, under whose guardianship
they crossed the dreaded Hounslow Heath without
fear of molestation.  At Hammersmith the coach
stopped again.  After a little parley between
William and the innkeeper, four men came out of
the inn with torches in their hands.  Two of them
placed themselves on each side of the coach, and
they slowly journeyed on again.  It was quite
dark now.  Gradually the road became busier and
more noisy, and houses appeared lining it at
intervals.  At length they had fairly entered the
metropolis.  The coach worked its way slowly along the
muddy streets, for it had been raining since they
left Staines, and the shouts of the linkmen were
almost deafening.  As they proceeded, another
coach suddenly appeared and attempted to pass
them.  This could not be permitted.  The coachman
whipped his horses, the linkmen screamed,
the great coach swayed to and fro with the
unusual pace.  Lady Ingram opened the window and
looked out, while the maid clasped her hands and
shrieked in her own tongue that she was killed.
</p>

<p>
"Not at all, <i>ma bonne</i>," was the calm response of
the mistress.  Then turning to Celia, she asked,
"You are not afraid?"
</p>

<p>
"Not unless you tell me there is something to
fear, Madam," answered Celia, in the quiescence
rather of ignorance than of courage.
</p>

<p>
"Ah!  I like that answer," replied Lady Ingram,
smiling her approval, and patting Celia's cheek.
"There is good metal in you, <i>ma chére</i>; it is only
the work that asks the polishing."
</p>

<p>
Celia wondered what the process of polishing
would be, and into what kind of creature she
would find herself transmuted when it was finished.
</p>

<p>
"William," said Lady Ingram, putting her head
out of the window, "whose coach is that other?"
</p>

<p>
"Sir John Scoresby's, Madam."
</p>

<p>
"A baronet of three years later," observed Lady
Ingram, quietly sinking back into her seat; "it is
impossible to give way."
</p>

<p>
"Ah, Madame!" faltered the <i>bonne</i>, in a shrill
key.  "Madame will renounce her right?  We
shall be over!  We shall be dead!"
</p>

<p>
"Impossible, my good Thérèse," was the placid
answer.  "I know what is due to myself and to
others.  To a baronet of one day earlier I should
of course give place without a word; but to one of
a day later&mdash;impossible!" replied Lady Ingram,
waving her hands with an air of utter finality.
</p>

<p>
"But if we are all killed?" faintly shrieked
Thérèse.
</p>

<p>
"Absurd!" said Lady Ingram.  "But if I were,
Thérèse, know that I should have the consolation
of dying in the discharge of my duty.  No soldier
can do more."
</p>

<p>
"Ah!  Madame is so high and philosophical!"
lamented Thérèse.  "Madame has the grand
thoughts!  <i>C'est magnifique</i>!  But we others, who
are but little people, and cannot console
ourselves&mdash;hélas!"
</p>

<p>
Meanwhile the battle was raging outside the
coach.  Shouts of "Scoresby!" and "Ingram!"
violent lashings of the struggling horses, oaths and
execrations, at last the flashing of daggers.  When
things arrived at this point, Lady Ingram again let
down the glass, which she had drawn up, and
Celia, like a coward, shut her eyes and put her
hands over her ears.  Thérèse was screaming
hysterically.
</p>

<p>
"Ah!" remarked the Baronet's widow, in a tone
of satisfaction, replacing the window, "we shall get
on now&mdash;William has stabbed the other coachman.
Thérèse, give over screaming in that way&mdash;so very
unnecessary! and Celia, my dear, do not put yourself
in that absurd position&mdash;it is like a coward!"
</p>

<p>
"But the man, Madam!&mdash;the poor coachman!&mdash;is
he killed?" questioned Celia, in a tone of horror.
</p>

<p>
"My dear, what does that signify?" said Lady
Ingram.  "A mere coachman&mdash;what can it matter?"
</p>

<p>
"But will you not ask, Madam?" pursued Celia,
in a very pained voice.
</p>

<p>
"Impossible, my dear!" replied Lady Ingram.
"I could not demean myself by such a question,
nor must you.  Really, Celia, your manners are so
wanting in repose!  You must learn not to put
yourself into a fever in this way for every little
thing that happens.  Imagine!  I, Lady Ingram,
stopping my coach, and yielding precedence to this
upstart Scoresby, to inquire whether this person&mdash;a
man of no family whatever&mdash;has had a little
more or less blood let out by my footman's thrust!
Ridiculous!"  And Lady Ingram spread out her dress.
</p>

<p>
Celia shrank back as far as she could into the
corner of the coach, and spoke, not in words, to
the only Friend she had present with her.  "Oh! send
me back to Ashcliffe!" was the strong cry of
her heart.  "This woman has no feelings whatever.
Unless there be some very necessary work
for me to do in Paris, send me back home!"
</p>

<p>
But there was very necessary work to be done
before she could go home.
</p>

<p>
After another quarter of a mile spent in struggling
through the mud, the coach drew up at the
door of a large house.  William, who seemed none
the worse for his battle, opened the door, and held
out his arm to assist his ladies in alighting.  Lady
Ingram motioned to Thérèse to go first, and the
maid laid her hand on the arm of her fellow-servant.
</p>

<p>
"Ah, bah!" exclaimed she, as she reached the
ground.  "Why you not wipe de blood from de
sleeve?  You spoil my cloak&mdash;faugh!"
</p>

<p>
"You had better not use your dagger, William,"
observed Lady Ingram, as she stepped out, "unless
it be necessary.  It frightens Madam Celia."  And
with a peculiar smile she looked back at her
step-daughter.
</p>

<p>
Celia followed Lady Ingram into a lighted hall,
where servants in blue and gold liveries stood
round, holding tapers in silver candlesticks.  They
seemed to recognize Lady Ingram, though Celia
noticed that William's livery was different from
theirs, and therefore imagined that the house she
was entering must be that of a stranger.  Lady
Ingram walked forward in her usual stately manner
until she reached the head of the staircase, closely
followed by Celia and Thérèse.  On the second
step from the top stood a gentleman in full dress,
blue and gold.  A conversation ensued between
him and Lady Ingram, accompanied by a great
deal of bowing and courtesying, flourishing of
hands and shaking of heads, which, being in
French, was of course lost upon Celia; but could
she have understood it, this was what she would
have heard.
</p>

<p>
"You do me such honor, Monsieur?"
</p>

<p>
"It is due to you, Madame."
</p>

<p>
"The second stair, Monsieur!  I am entitled
only to the head of the staircase."
</p>

<p>
"Madame will permit me to express my sense
of her distinction."
</p>

<p>
"You overwhelm me, Monsieur!"
</p>

<p>
"Pray let Madame proceed."
</p>

<p>
"Not until Monsieur has done so."
</p>

<p>
"Precedence to the ladies!"
</p>

<p>
"By no means before His Majesty's Consul!"
</p>

<p>
Here, then, appeared likely to be an obstacle to
farther progress: but after a good deal more
palaver, the grave point of precedence, which each
was courteously striving to yield to the other, was
settled by Lady Ingram and the Consul each setting
a foot upon the top stair at the same moment.
They then passed forward, hand in hand, Celia as
before following her step-mother.  The three
entered a large, handsome drawing-room, where a
further series of bowing and courtesying ensued
before Lady Ingram would sit down.  Celia
supposed that she might follow her example, and
being very tired, she seated herself at the same
time as her step-mother; for which act she was
rewarded with a glance of disapprobation from
Lady Ingram's dark eyes.  She sprang up again,
feeling puzzled and fluttered, whereupon the
Consul advanced to her, and addressed her in French
with a series of low bows.  Celia could only courtesy
to him, and look helplessly at her step-mother.
Lady Ingram uttered a few languid words in
French, and then said in English to Celia, "Pray
sit down.  You have to be told everything."
</p>

<p>
So she sat, silent and wearied, until after a time
the door flew open, and half a dozen servants
entered bearing trays, which they presented first
to Lady Ingram and then to Celia.  The first tray
contained cups of coffee, the second preserved
fruits, the third custards, the fourth various kinds
of sweetmeats.  Celia mentally wondered whether
the French supped on sugar-plums; but the fifth
tray containing cakes, she succeeded in finding
something edible.  Lady Ingram, she noticed,
after a cup of coffee and one or two cakes, devoted
her attention to the sugar-plums.
</p>

<p>
"You are tired?" asked Lady Ingram, turning
to Celia.  "Very well, you shall go to bed.  I
will leave the forming of your manners at present;
by and by I shall have something to say to you.
Thérèse will dress your hair in the morning.
Adieu! come and embrace me."
</p>

<p>
Thérèse appeared at the door, and after giving
her some directions in French, her mistress
desired Celia to courtesy to the Consul and follow
Thérèse.  The maid led Celia into a tolerably
large room, with a French bed, which Thérèse
informed her that she would have to herself.
</p>

<p>
"Ah! dat you have de hair beautifuls!" said
Thérèse, as she combed it out.  "I arrange it
to-morrow.  Mademoiselle like Madame?"
</p>

<p>
Celia liked no part of this speech.  She knew
that her hair was not beautiful, and felt that
Thérèse was flattering her; while whatever might be
her feelings on the subject of Lady Ingram, she
had no intention of communicating them to her
Ladyship's maid.  Her answer was distant and
evasive.
</p>

<p>
"Aha!" said Thérèse, with a soft laugh to herself.
"Perhaps Mademoiselle shall like Monsieur
Philippe.  Monsieur Philippe love to hear of
Mademoiselle."
</p>

<p>
Celia's heart warmed in a moment to her
unknown brother.  "How old is he?" she asked.
</p>

<p>
"Nineteen," said Thérèse.
</p>

<p>
"And my eldest brother, how old is he?"
</p>

<p>
"Sir Edward?" asked the French maid.  "Ah!
I see him very little.  He is two, tree, five year
older as Monsieur Philippe.  He come never."
</p>

<p>
Celia resolved to question Thérèse no further,
and the latter continued brushing her hair in
silence.
</p>

<p>
"That will do, Thérèse," she said, when this
process was completed.  "I will not keep you any
longer," she explained, seeing that the French girl
looked puzzled.
</p>

<p>
"Mademoiselle undress herself?" asked Thérèse,
with open eyes.
</p>

<p>
"Yes, thank you&mdash;I like it better.  I wish to
read a little first."
</p>

<p>
"De great ladies read never," laughed Thérèse.
"Mademoiselle leave de book in Englands.  Madame
not like de read."
</p>

<p>
"I will never leave you in England," whispered
Celia to her little Bible, resting her cheek upon it,
when Thérèse was gone.  "But oh!  how shall I
follow your teaching here?  I know so little, and
have so little strength!"
</p>

<p>
And a low soft whisper came into her heart,&mdash;"Lo!
I am with you alway, even unto the end of
the world."[<a id="chap04fn5text"></a><a href="#chap04fn5">5</a>]
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
"When Mademoiselle is ready, Madame wish
speak with her at her dressing-chamber."
</p>

<p>
This message was brought to Celia by Thérèse
the next morning.  She was already dressed and
reading.
</p>

<p>
"Ah! dat Mademoiselle is early!" exclaimed
Thérèse, lifting her eyebrows.  "Mademoiselle
read always."
</p>

<p>
There was a concealed sarcasm about everything
this woman said to her, which was particularly
distasteful to Celia.  She rose and closed
her book, only replying, "I will come to my
Lady now."
</p>

<p>
Thérèse led her along the passage into a
handsomely-furnished room, where, robed in a blue
cashmere dressing-gown, Lady Ingram sat, with
her long dark hair down upon her shoulders.
</p>

<p>
"Ah! good morning.  Early!" was her short
greeting to Celia, who bent down and kissed her.
</p>

<p>
"Now, my dear," pursued Lady Ingram,
"please to sit down on that chair facing me.  I
have two or three remarks to make.  You shall
have your first lesson in the polishing you need so
much."
</p>

<p>
Celia took the seat indicated with some trepidation,
but more curiosity.
</p>

<p>
"Very well," said her step-mother.  "Now, first,
about blushing.  You <i>must</i> get rid of that habit
of blushing.  There&mdash;you are at it now.  Look in
the mirror, and see if it does not spoil your
complexion.  A woman of the world, Celia, never
blushes.  It is quite old-fashioned and obsolete.
So much for that."
</p>

<p>
"But, Madam,"&mdash;Celia began, and hesitated.
</p>

<p>
"Go on, my dear," said Lady Ingram.  "You
are not putting enough powder on the left side,
Thérèse."
</p>

<p>
"If you please, Madam, I cannot stop blushing,"
pleaded Celia, doing it very much.  "It depends
upon my feelings."
</p>

<p>
"Well, it looks as if you could not," answered
Lady Ingram, with a short, hard laugh.  "But,
my dear, you <i>must</i>.  And as to feelings, Celia, a
modish woman never has any feelings.  Feeling is
the one thing absolutely forbidden by the mode.
Laugh as much as you please, but mind how you
feel merry; and as to crying, that is not allowable
except in particular circumstances.  It looks well
to see a girl weep for the death of her father or
mother, and, within reasonable limits, for a brother
or sister.  But if you are ever left a widow, you
must be very careful not to weep for the loss of
your husband: that would stamp you instantly.
And it is not <i>bien séant</i> for a mother to cry much
over her children&mdash;certainly not unless they are
quite babies.  A few tears&mdash;just a few&mdash;may be
very well in that case, if you have a laced
handkerchief at hand.  But you must never look
astonished, no matter what happens to you.  And,
Celia, last night, when the Consul spoke to you,
you absolutely looked perplexed."
</p>

<p>
"I felt so, Madam," said Celia.
</p>

<p>
"Is not that just what I am telling you?"
replied Lady Ingram, with that graceful wave of her
hands which Celia had seen before.  "My dear,
you must not feel.  Feeling is the one thing which
the mode cannot permit."
</p>

<p>
"Pardon me, Madam," answered Celia, looking
perplexed now; "but it seems to me that you are
trying to make me into a statue."
</p>

<p>
"Exactly so, my dear Celia&mdash;that is just it.  A
modish woman is a piece of live marble: she eats,
she drinks, elegantly and in small quantities&mdash;she
sleeps, taking care not to lie ungracefully&mdash;she
walks, glidingly and smoothly&mdash;she converses, but
must be careful not to mean too much&mdash;she
distributes her smiles at pleasure, but never shows
real interest in any person.  My dear, a heart is
absolute ruin to a modish woman!  She may do
anything she likes but feel.  Now look at me.
Have you seen any exhibition of feeling in me
since you have known me?"
</p>

<p>
Celia felt herself quite safe in acquitting Lady
Ingram on that count.
</p>

<p>
"No, of course not," continued her step-mother;
"I hope I know myself and the mode too well.
Now, as to walking, what do you think the Consul
said to me last night when you left the room?"
</p>

<p>
Celia confessed her inability to guess it.
</p>

<p>
"He said, 'What a pity that young lady cannot
walk!'"
</p>

<p>
Celia's eyes opened rather widely.
</p>

<p>
"It is quite true, you absolutely cannot walk.
You have no idea of walking but to go backwards
or forwards.  A walk should be a graceful, gliding
motion, only just not dancing.  There&mdash;that will
do for this morning.  As to walking, you shall
have dancing lessons; but remember the other
things I tell you.  You must not blush, nor weep,
nor eat more than you can help&mdash;in public, of
course, I mean; you can eat an ox in your own
chamber, if you please&mdash;and above everything
else, you must give over feeling.  You can go now
if you wish it."
</p>

<p>
"Madam, you order impossibilities!" said Celia,
with tears in her eyes.  "I will eat as little as
you please, if it keep me alive; and I will do
my best to walk in any manner you wish me.  I
will try to give over blushing, if I can, though
really I do not know how to set about it; but to
give over feeling&mdash;Madam, I cannot do it.  I do
not think I ought to do it, even at your command.
I must weep when I am sorrowful&mdash;I must laugh
when I am diverted.  I will not do it more than I
can help, but I cannot make any promise beyond
that."
</p>

<p>
"Ah! there you are!" said Lady Ingram,
laughing.  "You island English, with your hearts
and your consciences, every man of you a Pope to
himself!  Well, I will not be too hard upon you at
first, <i>ma belle</i>.  That will do for the present.  By
and by I shall exact more."
</p>

<p>
Celia had a request to prefer before she went.
</p>

<p>
"Madam," she asked, trembling very much, "if
it pleased you, and you had no desire that I should
do otherwise, would you give me leave to hear
Dr. Sacheverell preach on Sunday?"
</p>

<p>
"<i>Ma chère!</i>" said Lady Ingram, "how can I, a
Catholic, choose between your Protestant teachers?
You shall go where you like.  The Consul has
been so good as to place one of his carriages at
my disposal, and as I shall remain here all the day,
I place it at yours.  I will bid William ask where
your great Doctor preaches."
</p>

<p>
Celia went slowly back to her own room, feeling
very strange, very lonely, and very miserable,
though she hardly knew why.  As soon as she
reached it, she proceeded to contravene all Lady
Ingram's orders by a good cry.  She felt all the
better for it; and having bathed her eyes, and
comforted herself with a few words out of her
Book, she was ready when Thérèse came to
summon her to go down to breakfast with her
step-mother.  They breakfasted in a room down-stairs,
the Consul and his wife being present; the latter
a voluble French woman, who talked very fast to
Lady Ingram.  The days passed drearily to Celia;
but she kept looking forward to the Sunday, on
which she hoped to hear a sermon different from
Dr. Braithwaite's.  When the Sunday arrived, the
carriage came round after breakfast to take Celia
to hear Dr. Sacheverell, who, William had learned,
was to preach at St. Andrew's that morning.  To
Holborn, therefore, the coach drove; and Celia
entered St. Andrew's Church alone.  She was put
into a great pew, presently filled with other ladies;
and the service was conducted by a young clergyman
in a fair wig, who seemed more desirous to
impress his hearers with himself than with his
subject.  Then the pulpit was mounted by a stout
man in a dark wig, who preached very fluently,
very energetically, and very dogmatically, a
discourse in which there were more politics than
religion, and very much more of Henry Sacheverell
than of Jesus Christ.
</p>

<p>
All the attention which Celia could spare from
the service and the preacher was concentrated in
amazement on her fellow-worshippers.  They were
tolerably attentive to the sermon, but on the
prayers they bestowed no notice whatever.  All
were dressed in the height of the fashion, and all
carried fans and snuff-boxes.  The former they
flourished, handled, unfurled, discharged, grounded,
recovered, and fluttered all through the
service.[<a id="chap04fn6text"></a><a href="#chap04fn6">6</a>]  Whenever the fans were still for a moment, the
snuff-boxes came into requisition, and the amount
of snuff consumed by these fashionable ladies
astonished Celia.  They talked in loud whispers,
with utter disregard to the sanctity of place and
circumstances; and the tone of their conversation
was another source of surprise to their hearer.
</p>

<p>
"Do you see Sir Thomas?"
</p>

<p>
"I am sure he is looking this way."
</p>

<p>
"There is Lady Betty&mdash;no, on your left."
</p>

<p>
"Lady Diana has not come this morning."
</p>

<p>
"How modishly she dresses!"
</p>

<p>
"Look at the Duchess&mdash;what a handsome brocade!"
</p>

<p>
"That lace cost five guineas the yard, I am certain."
</p>

<p>
Then came a fresh flourishing of fans, varied by
the occasional rising and courtesying of one of the
ladies, as she recognized an acquaintance in the
fashionable crowd.  Did these women really believe
themselves in the special presence of God? thought
Celia.  Surely they never could!  There
was one point of the service at which all their
remarks were hushed, their fans still, and their
attention concentrated.  This was during the singing.
Celia found that no member of the congregation
thought of joining the psalmody, which was left to
a choir located in the gallery.  At the close of
each chant, audible comments were whispered
round.
</p>

<p>
"How exceeding sweet!"
</p>

<p>
"What a divine voice she hath!"
</p>

<p>
"Beautiful, that E-la!"
</p>

<p>
And when the prayers followed, the snuff-boxes
and fans began figuring again.
</p>

<p>
On the whole, Celia was glad when this service
was over.  Even Dr. Braithwaite was better than
this.  And then she thought of her friends at
Ashcliffe, and how they would be rumbling home in the
old family-coach, as she stepped in her loneliness
into the Consul's splendid carriage.  Did they miss
her, she wondered, and were they thinking of her
then, while her heart was dwelling sadly and
longingly upon them?  She doubted not that they did
both.
</p>

<p>
"<i>Et bien?</i>" said Lady Ingram, interrogatively,
when she met Celia after dinner.  "Did you like
your great preacher?"
</p>

<p>
"Not at all, Madam."
</p>

<p>
"Not at all?  Then I wonder why you went.
You look disappointed, <i>ma belle</i>.  You must not
look disappointed&mdash;It gives awkward lines to the
face.  Here&mdash;take some of this cake to console
you; it is particularly good."
</p>

<p>
Celia took the cake, but not the consolation.
</p>

<p>
"At eleven o'clock on Tuesday, my child, we
depart for Paris.  Do not give yourself any trouble.
Thérèse will do all your packing.  Only you must
not walk in Paris, until you have some clothes fit
to be seen.  I will order stuffs sent in at once
when we arrive, and set the women to work for you."
</p>

<p>
"Do you know, Madam, if you please"&mdash;Celia
hesitated, and seemed a little uncomfortable.
</p>

<p>
"Go on, child," said Lady Ingram.  "Never
stop in the middle of a sentence, unless you choose
to affect the pretty-innocence style.  Well?"
</p>

<p>
"Do you know, Madam, whether there be any
Protestant service in Paris?"
</p>

<p>
"I imagine there is a Huguenot <i>prêche</i>
somewhere&mdash;or was one.  I am not sure if I heard not
something about His Majesty having stopped
them.  Do not put your Protestantism too much
forward there&mdash;the Court do not like it."
</p>

<p>
"I have nothing to do with the Court, Madam,"
said Celia, with sudden firmness; "and I am a
Protestant, and I cannot disguise my religion."
</p>

<p>
"Oh dear! your Protestant consciences!"
murmured Lady Ingram.  "But you have to do with
the Court, my friend; it is to the Court that I am
taking you.  Do you suppose that I live in the
atmosphere of a recluse?  When I am an old woman
of eighty, <i>ma chère</i>, very likely I shall repair
to a convent to make my salvation; but not just
now, if you please."
</p>

<p>
"I am not an old woman&mdash;" Celia was beginning,
but Lady Ingram interrupted her.
</p>

<p>
"Precisely, <i>ma belle</i>.  The very reason why it is
so absurd of you to make a recluse of yourself, as
I see you would like to do,&mdash;unless, indeed, you
had a vocation.  But, so far as I know, Protestants
never have such things."
</p>

<p>
"What things, Madam?"
</p>

<p>
"Vocations, my dear&mdash;calls to the religious life."
</p>

<p>
"Madam!" exclaimed Celia, very much astonished,
"ought we not all to lead religious lives?"
</p>

<p>
"You are so absurd!" laughed Lady Ingram.
"You absolutely do not understand what is meant
by the religious life.  My dear child (for a child
you are indeed), the life which we all lead is the
secular: we eat, drink, talk, sleep, dance, game
and marry.  These are the seculars who do these
things.  The religious are those who, having a
call from Heaven, consecrate themselves entirely
to God, and deny themselves all pleasures whatever,
and so much of necessaries as is consistent
with the preservation of life.  Their mortification
is accepted by Heaven, when extreme, not only
for their own sins, but for the sins of any secular
friend to whom they may desire to apply the
merit of it.  Now do you understand?  <i>Ma foi!</i>
what a grave, saint-like conversation you provoke!"
</p>

<p>
"Not at all, Madam."
</p>

<p>
"Let me hear your views then."
</p>

<p>
Had Celia been left free to choose, Lady Ingram
was about the last person in her little world to
whom she would have wished to give a reason for
the hope that was in her.  But she felt that there
was no choice, and she must make the effort,
though not in her own strength.  She lifted up her
heart to God for wisdom, and then spoke with a
quiet decision which surprised her step-mother.
</p>

<p>
"Madam, I believe all persons to be religious
who love God, and whom God loves.  Because
God loved us, He gave His Son to die for us,
that we who believe in Him might have eternal life.
It is He who saves us, not we who make our
own salvation; and it is because we love God
that we wish to serve Him."
</p>

<p>
"Well, my dear," answered Lady Ingram, slowly,
as if considering Celia's speech, "I can see very
little difference between us, except that you would
have all men hermits and friars instead of some.
We both believe in Jesus Christ, of course; and no
doubt there is a certain sense in which the religious
feel love to God, and this love inclines them to the
cloister.  I do not therefore see wherein we differ
except on a few unimportant points."
</p>

<p>
Celia saw an immense distance between them, on
points neither few nor unimportant; but the courage
which had risen to a high tide was ebbing away,
and her heart failed her.
</p>

<p>
"Well, this will do for to-day, my fair divine,"
said Lady Ingram, with a smile.  "Now bring me
my silk-winders, and hold that skein of red silk
while I wind it&mdash;or stay, is that a matter of
conscience, my little votaress?"
</p>

<p>
"On the Lord's Day, Madam, it is, if you please."
</p>

<p>
"Very well, let the silk alone; I can wind it
to-morrow just as well.  Would it be breaking the
Sabbath for you to tell Thérèse that I wish to
speak with her?  Pray don't if you feel at all
uncomfortable."
</p>

<p>
Celia gave the message to Thérèse, and then
locked herself into her own room, and relieved her
feelings by another fit of crying.

"Now, use your eyes, my young anchorite&mdash;if it
be not wicked to look out of the window: this
is the Rue de Rivoli, the finest street in Paris.  By
the way, you ought not to have been ill in crossing
the Channel&mdash;so very undignified.  Here is my
town-house&mdash;that with the portico.  Till your
manners are formed, I shall give you a private closet
as well as a bedroom, and an antechamber where
you can take lessons in French and dancing.&mdash;&mdash;
Good evening, St. Estèphe!  Is Monsieur Philippe
here?"
</p>

<p>
"Monsieur Philippe is not at himself, Madame;
he ride out with Monsieur Bontems."
</p>

<p>
Lady Ingram knitted her brows, as if the information
were not agreeable to her.  She alighted,
and desired Celia to follow her up-stairs.  Through
suites of spacious rooms, splendidly furnished, and
along wide corridors she led the way to a quiet
suite of apartments at one end of the house&mdash;an
antechamber, a bedroom, and a small but elegant
boudoir.
</p>

<p>
"These are your rooms," she said.  "I will give
you a new attendant, for I must have Thérèse to
myself now.  These will be entirely at your
disposal, within certain restrictions.  I shall visit
you every morning, to have your masters' opinions
as to your improvement, and you will take a dish
of coffee or chocolate with me in my boudoir
at four o'clock every afternoon.  Until you are
formed, you must dine alone, except when I
dine entirely <i>en famille</i>.  Your masters will attend
you in the antechamber every morning.  No one
must be permitted to cross the threshold of
your boudoir, except myself and your brothers,
your own attendant, or any person sent by me.
Do you dislike that?"
</p>

<p>
"No, Madam; I am very glad to hear it."
</p>

<p>
"Ah! my Sister of St. Ursula!" said Lady
Ingram, laughing.  "But remember this is only
until you are formed, and the sooner that happens
the better pleased I shall be."
</p>

<p>
"I am anxious to obey your wishes in everything
not forbidden by my conscience, Madam."
</p>

<p>
"Very well," said Lady Ingram, still laughing.
"The conscience requires a little formation too,
<i>ma belle</i>, as well as the manners.  Farewell!  I will
send your attendant."
</p>

<p>
She sailed away with her usual languid stateliness,
and Celia went forward into the bedroom.
She was vainly endeavoring to find an unlocked
drawer in which to place her hood and cloak, when
a low, quiet voice behind her said:
</p>

<p>
"Here are the keys, Madam.  Will you allow
me to open them for you?"
</p>

<p>
Celia looked up into a face which won her
confidence at once.  Its owner was a woman
of middle height, whose age might be slightly
under sixty.  Her dress was of almost Quaker
simplicity, and black.  Her hair and eyes were of
no particular color, but light rather than dark; her
face wore no expression beyond a placid calm.
But Celia fancied that she saw a peculiar, deep
look in the eyes, as if those now passionless
features might have borne an expression of
great suffering once.
</p>

<p>
"Oh, thank you!" said Celia, simply.  "Is it
you whom my Lady promised to send?"
</p>

<p>
"I am to be your woman, Madam.  I am
her Ladyship's sewing-woman; my name is Patient
Irvine."
</p>

<p>
The "lady's woman" of the seventeenth and
eighteenth centuries was the ancestress rather of
the modern companion than of the maid.  She
was called by her Christian or surname, sewed for
her mistress, and assisted her in dressing; but in
every other particular the mistress and maid were
upon equal terms.  The "woman" was her lady's
constant companion, and nearly always her
<i>confidante</i>.  She sat at her mistress's table, went with
her into company, and appeared as a member of
her family when she received her friends.  As
a rule, she was the equal of her lady in education,
and not seldom her superior.  Her inferiority lay
in birth and fortune, sometimes in the latter
only.
</p>

<p>
"And what would you like me to call you?&mdash;Patience
or Irvine?" asked Celia of her new
acquaintance.
</p>

<p>
"Patient, if you please, Madam."
</p>

<p>
"Patient&mdash;not Patience?"
</p>

<p>
"I was not baptized Patience, Madam.  My
father was a Scottish Covenanter, and he named
me, his first-born child, 'The-Patient-Waiting-for-Christ.'"
</p>

<p>
"What a strange name!" involuntarily exclaimed
Celia.
</p>

<p>
"Yes, Madam; very strange, I doubt not, to
such as have never met with our Puritan practice
of Scripture-text names.  I have known divers
such."
</p>

<p>
"Do the Puritans, then, commonly give their
children such names?"
</p>

<p>
"Very often, Madam.  I had an aunt who was
called 'We-Love-Him-Because-He-First-Loved-Us.'"
</p>

<p>
"They called her Love for short, I suppose?"
</p>

<p>
"Yes, Madam," answered Patient, in her calm,
passive manner.
</p>

<p>
Celia thought this very odd indeed, and turned
the conversation, lest she should get comic
associations with texts of Scripture of which she could
not afterwards divest herself.  She wondered that
Patient did not feel the ludicrous strangeness of
the practice, not knowing that all sense of the
ludicrous had been left out of Patient's composition.
</p>

<p>
"And how long have you lived in France, Patient?"
</p>

<p>
"Since I was of the age of twenty years, Madam Celia."
</p>

<p>
"You know my name, then?" said Celia, smiling.
</p>

<p>
"I know you, Madam, much better than you
know me.  I have borne you about in mine arms
as a babe of a few hours old.  And just now, when
I saw you, you looked to mine eyes as the very
image from the dead of my dear Miss Magdalene."
</p>

<p>
"Patient! do you mean my mother?"
</p>

<p>
"Yes Madam.  I ask your pardon for calling
her such a name, but it ever sounds more natural
to mine ear.  She was my Lady Ingram for so
short a time, and I knew her as Miss Magdalene
when she was but a wee bonnie bairn."
</p>

<p>
"What was her name?"
</p>

<p>
"Magdalene Grey, Madam.  She was the
Minister's daughter at the Manse of Lauchie, where
my father and I dwelt."
</p>

<p>
"Then she was a Scottish lady?"
</p>

<p>
"Yes, Madam, at least she was born in Scotland,
and her mother was Scottish.  Her father, Mr. Grey,
was English by descent, though his fathers
had dwelt in Scotland for three generations afore
him."
</p>

<p>
"And where did my father meet with her?  He
was not Scottish?"
</p>

<p>
"He was not, Madam.  And I will tell you all
the story if it please you; but will you not dress
now?"
</p>

<p>
"You can tell me while I comb my hair, Patient.
I want to know all about it."
</p>

<p>
"May I do it for you, Madam?  I can speak
now, if that be your pleasure; but 'tis almost
necessary that I tell mine own story in hers."
</p>

<p>
"Will it pain you, Patient?" asked Celia,
kindly.
</p>

<p>
"No, Madam; I am far past that," answered
Patient, in her calm, passionless voice.
</p>

<p>
"Then please to let me hear it."
</p>

<p>
"My father's name, please you," Patient began,
"was Alexander Leslie, and he dwelt on Lauchie
Farm, near to the Manse.  And sith Mr. Grey, our
Minister, wedded Mrs. Jean Leslie, of the same
clan, it fell out that Miss Magdalene and I were
somewhat akin, though in worldly goods she was
much beyond us.  For Mr. Grey was not one of
our poor ministers of Scotland, but a rich
Englishman, who made his way into what the English
deemed our wild valleys, for no cause but only the
love of Christ.  Miss Magdalene being an only
bairn, without brother or sister, it so fell that I
and Roswith were called up whiles to the Manse
to divert her."
</p>

<p>
"You and who?"
</p>

<p>
"Roswith, my sister."
</p>

<p>
"What strange names your father gave his
daughters!"
</p>

<p>
"Ay, that was a strange name, and all said so.
It came out of an old chronicle that he had, a very
ancient book, and he deemed it a fair name, and
gave it in the baptizing to his youngest-born.
Those were evil days, Madam, on which we fell.
Yet why should I call them evil, when they were
days of growing in the truth, and of the great
honor of suffering for the Lord's sake?  Mr. Grey,
your grandfather, Madam, was a very gracious
man, and did preach most savory discourses.
Wherefore, he was one of the first on whom the
blow fell.  And when King Charles sent his
troopers into our parts, under command of
Claverhouse,[<a id="chap05fn1text"></a><a href="#chap05fn1">1</a>] bidding them hunt and slay all
that would not conform unto his way, they came,
one of the first places, into our valley.  Many an
humble and honest husbandman, that feared God,
was hung up at his own door by the wicked
Claverhouse and his troopers, and many a godly man
and woman was constrained to dwell in caves and
dens of the earth until this enemy was overpast.
I could tell many a tale of those days that would
stir your blood, Madam, if it pleased you to hear
it.  We were amongst those whom the Lord was
pleased to honor by permitting them to suffer for
His name's sake.  Mr. Grey refused to fly.  He
was dragged down, one Sabbath morn, from the
pulpit in Lauchie Kirk, Claverhouse himself being
at the door.  He had been preaching unto us a
most sweet, godly, and gracious discourse of
casting care upon the Lord, and standing firm in the
truth.  And just when he was speaking that great
and precious promise of the Lord, 'Lo!  I am with
you alway, even unto the end of the world,' the
troopers burst in.  Then the whole kirk thronged
around our Minister, and sought to free him from
the evil men.  Mine uncle Jock Leslie, fell, thrust
through with the swords of the troopers, and many
another.  But at length they had their wicked
will, and bound us, men, women, and children, two
and two, with one strong rope, like a gang of
slaves going to the market-place.  I was greatly
honored to have the next place to Mr. Grey, hand
in hand with whom walked Miss Magdalene, a
sweet young maid of scarce fourteen years.  His
godly wife was bound, just before, with Janet
Campbell, an old wife of nigh eighty.  So we were
marched down eleven miles to the shore.  Ah! but
my heart ached for Miss Magdalene and Roswith
ere we reached it!  It was a grand comfort to find
Roswith bound with me, for she was but a wee
wean of eight years, and I a grown maiden of
twenty.  Doubtless this was the Lord's mercy.
When we came to the sea, we saw a great ship
lying afar off, and we were all thrust into boats to
carry us thither.  When we were aboard, the
troopers, some of whom came with us, did drive
us below, and shut down the hatches upon us:
which, it being summer time, was hot and painful,
and many women and children fell sick therewith.
Whither we were to go we knew not, only Mr. Grey
surmised that they thought either to sell us
for slaves in Barbary unto the heathen there, or
else to convey us unto the King's plantations in
Virginia or those parts; though if they were bound
unto Virginia he knew not wherefore they should
set sail from the eastern part of the kingdom.
For three days and nights we were thus kept
under hatches, to our much discomfort, and the
ship sailing northwards with all the speed the
sailors could make.  During which time we were
greatly comforted with the thought of Christ our
Lord, and the three days and three nights which
He was in the heart of the earth.  Likewise
Mr. Grey did oft exhort us, and prayed us to bear all
that should come upon us meekly and bravely,
and as unto the Lord.  Then some of us which
were mighty in the Scriptures did say certain parts
thereof for the comfort of the rest; in particular,
old Jamie Campbell, Janet's guidman, and Elsie
Armstrong, his sister's daughter.  So passed these
three days until the Wednesday even.  And then
arose a great and mighty tempest, with contrary
winds, driving the ship down, so that, notwithstanding
all the skill of the shipmen, she lost in
one day and night more than she had gained in
all the three.  Verily she fled like a mad thing
afore the violence of that wind.  And on the
Thursday night, a little on the hither side of
midnight, she flying as thistledown afore the wind, we
felt a mighty shock, and suddenly the water came
in at our feet with a great rush.  Mr. Grey said he
thought the ship must have lighted on some rock,
and that a hole was driven in her.  Then the
shipmen opened the hatches, and in dolorous voices
bade us come up on deck, for we were all like to
drown.  Wherefore we ascended the ladders,
thirty-five in all our company, I alway holding
tight the hand of my wee sister.  When we were
upon deck, we found from the words of the
shipmen that they were about to loose the boats.  So
when all the boats were loosed, the troopers filled
two of them and the seamen the third, and no
room was left for the prisoners.  Then in this
time we thought much on Paul and his shipwreck,
and how the seamen were minded to kill the
prisoners lest any should escape: and we marvelled
if they counselled to kill us, seeing there was no
room for us in the boats."
</p>

<p>
"O Patient! surely they laid no hands on any
of you?"
</p>

<p>
"No, Madam; they left that to the wind and
the sea.  The three boats cast off, and we prisoners
stood alone on the deck of the sinking ship.
We had neither wit nor material to make any
more boats nor rafts.  And when we saw our
death thus before us&mdash;for our ship, like Paul's,
was stuck fast in the forepart, but the sea beat
freely on the hinder&mdash;we stood like men stupid
and amazed for a short season.  But then above
all the noise of the storm came Mr. Grey's voice,
which we were used to obeying, saying, 'Brethren,
in a few hours at most, perchance in a few
minutes, we shall stand before God.  Let our last
hour be employed in His worship.'  Then we
gathered all around him, on that part of the ship
which was fast on the rock, and he led the exercise
with that Psalm:[<a id="chap05fn2text"></a><a href="#chap05fn2">2</a>]
</p>

<p class="poem">
  'O God, the heathen entered have<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thine heritage; by them<br />
  Defiled is Thine house: on heaps<br />
  They laid Jerusalem.'<br />
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
"After the Psalm there was an exhortation.
Our Minister bade us remember that we were
the Lord's freedmen&mdash;doubly so now, since our
enemies had cast us away from them, and we were
left only on the mercy of our God.  Moreover, he
recalled that of David, saying in his strait, 'Let me
fall into the hand of the Lord, for His mercies are
great.'[<a id="chap05fn3text"></a><a href="#chap05fn3">3</a>]  Then he prayed with us; and while the
exercise yet lasted, and Mr. Grey was still praying,
and entreating the Lord to deal with us in his
mercy, whether for life or for death,&mdash;but if it
should be death, as there seemed no other, to
grant, if it so pleased Him, an easy dying unto
the little children in especial&mdash;while he prayed,
the ship parted asunder with a great crash, and the
waves, leaping up on that part which stuck fast,
swept every soul of us out into the boiling sea."
</p>

<p>
"O Patient, what a dreadful story!  And how
many were saved?"
</p>

<p>
"Four, Madam."
</p>

<p>
"Only four out of thirty-five!"
</p>

<p>
"Ah, Madam! the thirty-one were happier than
any of the four!"
</p>

<p>
"Who were saved, Patient?"
</p>

<p>
"Miss Magdalene, and wee Jamie Campbell&mdash;old
Jamie's grandson&mdash;and Roswith, and me.'
</p>

<p>
"And not one of the others?" said Celia, pityingly.
</p>

<p>
"Not one.  They were carried by the angels
into the rest of the Lord, and He would not
grudge them the crown of martyrdom."
</p>

<p>
"And how did you get ashore?"
</p>

<p>
"That, Madam, I never knew.  I mind falling
into the water, and sinking down, it seemed to me,
far and low therein; and then I was buoyed up
again to the top, and I tried to make some little
struggle for life.  But the waters closed over me
again, and I knew no more.  The next minute, as
it felt, I was lying with mine eyes shut, methought,
in my little bed at Lauchie.  I thought I had
dreamed a bad dream, sith I felt stiff, and sore,
and cold, and wet, all over: but as I awoke, I
felt it was truly so: and at last I oped mine eyes
and strove to sit.  Then I saw that I sat on the
sea-sand, and above me the blue sky, and I all alone:
and an exceeding bitter cry rose to my lips as it
came back upon me what had been.  When I
fancied I heard a bit groan no so far from me
and I struggled up on my feet, and crept, rather
than walked, wondering I had no bones broken, to
a cleft of the rocks whence methought the groan
came.  And there was Jamie Campbell, lying
sorely bruised and hurt; and when I stooped to
him he lifted up his eyes, and saith, 'O Patient!  I
thought all were drowned, and that there was none
here but God.'  I said, 'Are you sore hurt, my
poor bairn?'  'Yea,' quoth he, 'for I cannot move
nor sit, and methinks I have some bones broke.'  Poor
laddie! he was in a sad way indeed.  I tare
mine own clothing to bind up his bruises, and
promising to return to him, I set out to see if any
other might have been saved from the wreck, ever
hoping to find my father, my mother, or Mr. Grey.
I walked upon the sand to the right hand, and saw
no sign of any soul: then I turned to the left
hand, and passing Jamie, walked far that way.
Not a soul did I see, and I was about turning
again in despair, accounting that he and I were the
only two alive, when all at once I fancied I heard
Roswith's voice.  I stood and hearkened&mdash;sure
enough it was Roswith's voice, for I never could
mistake that.  I could not hear whence it came,
and so weak was I become with sorrow and weariness
and fasting, that methought she was speaking
to me from Heaven.  Then I called, 'Roswith!'
and heard her cry as in joy, 'Patient!  O Miss
Magdalene, Patient is alive! here is Patient!'  And
before I knew aught more, her little arms
were around me, and Miss Magdalene, white and
wan, stood at my side."
</p>

<p>
"How had they been saved?"
</p>

<p>
"They knew that no more than I did, Madam.
Truly, Roswith, like a bit fanciful lassie, said she
thought the Lord sent an angel to help her, and
talked of walking over some rocks.  I had not the
heart to gainsay the bairn, and how did I know
that the Lord had not sent His angel?  Well, we all
got back to Jamie Campbell, but what little I could
do for him was no good; he died that forenoon.
Then I said we would set forth and seek some
house, for it was eleven hours gone since we had
eaten food.  But afore we could depart, the
tempest, which was somewhat lulled, washed up two
bodies at our feet, Mr. Grey's and Elsie
Armstrong's.  We poor weak maids could do nought
for their burying; but Miss Magdalene cut off a
lock of her father's hair, and kissed him, and wept
over him.  Then we set out to try and find some
house near.  When at last, after two hours' good
walking, we reached a cot, we found to our sorrow
that they spake a strange tongue.  Miss Magdalene
was the only one of us that could speak their
speech, and she told us that the country where we
were thus cast was the North of France."
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
"Patient!  Patient Irvine, where are you?"
</p>

<p>
"Here, Sir," answered Patient to the voice without.
"Your brother, Madam, Mr. Philip Ingram."
</p>

<p>
Celia was half-way across the room before she
remembered that one side of her hair was still
floating on her shoulders.
</p>

<p>
"I will take him into your closet, Madam," said
Patient, as she left the room.
</p>

<p>
The colloquy outside was audible within.
</p>

<p>
"Mr. Philip, will you wait a few minutes?  I
have not ended dressing Madam's hair, but by the
time you have changed your boots she will be
ready to see you."
</p>

<p>
"Pray what is the matter with my boots?"
</p>

<p>
"They are splashed all over, Sir.  My Lady
would not allow you to come into Madam's closet
with such boots as those, which you know."
</p>

<p>
"Leather and prunella!  Never mind my boots
nor my mother neither!"
</p>

<p>
"Sir!" responded Patient, in a tone which
admitted of but one interpretation.
</p>

<p>
"Well, come, I don't mean&mdash;&mdash;you are always
making me say something I don't mean, you dear
old tease!"
</p>

<p>
"Sir, I must obey my Lady's orders."
</p>

<p>
"Must you, really?  Well, then, I suppose I
must.  Eh!  Madam Patient?"
</p>

<p>
"If you will please to change your boots,
Mr. Philip," quietly repeated Patient, "Madam will be
ready to receive you in a few minutes."
</p>

<p>
"Very well, Madam Patient.  I will obey your orders."
</p>

<p>
And the boots were heard quickly conveying
their owner down the corridor.  Celia's hair was
soon put up, for she was very wishful to make the
acquaintance of her half-brother; and she was in
the boudoir waiting for him before Mr. Philip
Ingram had completed the changing of his
objectionable boots.
</p>

<p>
"Come in!" she said, with a beating heart, to
the light tap at her door.
</p>

<p>
"Are you my sister Celia?  I am very glad to
see you&mdash;very glad.  I must congratulate dear old
Patient on having finished you sooner than I
expected."
</p>

<p>
The first greeting over, Celia looked curiously at
her half-brother.  He was not like what she had
anticipated, and, except for a slight resemblance
about the eyes, he was not like Lady Ingram.  He
looked older than his years&mdash;so much so, that if
Celia had not known that he was her junior, she
would have supposed him to be her senior by some
years.  Philip Ingram was of middle height,
inclining rather to the higher side of it, slenderly
built, thin, lithe, and very active in his movements,
with much quickness, physical and mental.  He
had dark glossy hair, brilliant dark eyes, and a
voice not unmusically toned.
</p>

<p>
"Well, Madam!" he said at last, laughingly;
"I hope you like me as well as I do you."
</p>

<p>
Celia laughed in her turn, and colored slightly.
"I have no doubt that I shall like my new brother
very much," she said.  "Whom do you think me like?"
</p>

<p>
"That is just what I cannot settle," said Philip,
gravely, considering her features.  "You are not
like Ned, except about the mouth; you have his
mouth and chin, but not his eyes and forehead."
</p>

<p>
"Am I like my father?"
</p>

<p>
"Don't recollect him a bit," said Philip.  "He
died before I was three years old."
</p>

<p>
"Edward is not here, is he?"
</p>

<p>
"No; he is on his travels."
</p>

<p>
"Where has he gone?"
</p>

<p>
"The stars know where!  He did not ask me
to go with him, and if he had done, my Lady-Mother
would have put an extinguisher upon it.  I
wish he were here; 'tis only endurable when he is."
</p>

<p>
"What is it that you dislike?"
</p>

<p>
"Everything in creation!" said Philip, kicking
a footstool across the room.
</p>

<p>
"You speak very widely," replied Celia, laughing,
and thinking of Charley Passmore.
</p>

<p>
"I speak very truly, as you will shortly find,
Madam, to your cost.  Wait until you have been
at one of her Ladyship's evening assemblies."
</p>

<p>
"I am not to go until she is better satisfied with
my manners," said Celia, simply.
</p>

<p>
Philip whistled.  "You will not lose much," he
answered.
</p>

<p>
"Don't you like them?"
</p>

<p>
"What is there to like?" asked Philip,
dissecting the tassel of the sofa-cushion.  "A
thousand yards of satin and lace, or the men and
women under them, whose hearts are marble and
their brains sawdust!  Celia Ingram, don't let my
mother spoil you!  From the little I see of you
now, I know you are not one of them.  Indeed, I
guessed that from what my mother told me.  She
said you were absolutely without a scrap of fine
breeding&mdash;which she meant as a censure, and I
took as a compliment.  I know what your grand
ladies are, and what their fine breeding is!  And
I hope you are a true English girl, with a heart
in you, and not one of these finnicking, fussy,
fickle, faithless French-women!"
</p>

<p>
Philip let the sofa-cushion go when he had
relieved his feelings by this burst of alliteration.
</p>

<p>
"I hope I have a heart, dear Philip," replied
Celia.  "But can you find no friends anywhere?"
</p>

<p>
"Just one," said Philip, "that is, beside Ned.
You see, when Ned is here, he is master; but
when he is away, I am not master: her Ladyship
is mistress and master too."
</p>

<p>
"But surely, Philip, you do not wish to disobey
your mother?"
</p>

<p>
"Disobey my mother!" answered Philip, reflectively,
and resuming the sofa-cushion.  "Well,
Madam, I never get much chance of doing that.
You don't know the sort of game my mother can
play sometimes!"
</p>

<p>
"What do you mean, Philip?"
</p>

<p>
"I will tell you what I mean.  Celia, there is a
very, very pleasant prospect before you.  Imprimis,
Madam, you will be converted; that is, if
she can manage it; and if she can't, it will show
that you are a clever hand.  In the latter case, the
probability is that she won't think you worth the
waste of any more time; but if she succeed in
converting you, she will then proceed to form you.
She will turn your feet out, and pinch your waist
in, and stick your head up, and make you laugh
when you are angry, and cry when you are pleased.
She will teach you to talk without interruption for
an hour, and yet to have said nothing when the
hour is over.  You will learn how to use your
eyes&mdash;how to look at people and not see them,
and <i>who</i> to see, or not to see.  I can give you a
hint about that, myself; a man who wears no
orders is nobody&mdash;you may safely omit seeing him.
A man of one order is to be treated with distant
civility; a man of two, with cordiality; but a
man who wears three is to be greeted with the
most extreme pleasure, and held in the closest
friendship."
</p>

<p>
"But if I don't like the man, I cannot make a
friend of him," said Celia, in a puzzled tone.
</p>

<p>
"My dear, that doesn't come into consideration.
You will have to learn never to look at the man,
but only at his coat and decorations.  A man is
not a man in genteel society; he is a Consul, a
Marquis, or a nobody.  Never look at nobodies;
but if a Duke should lead you to a chair, be
transported with delight.  You have a great deal to
learn, I see.  Well, after you have got all this by
heart&mdash;I am afraid it will take a long while!&mdash;my
mother will proceed with her work.  The last act
will be to take your heart out of you, and put
instead of it a lump of stone, cut to the proper
shape and size, and painted so as to imitate the
reality too exactly for any one to guess it an
imitation.  And then, with a lot of satin and velvet and
lace on the top, Mrs. Celia Ingram, you will be
finished!"
</p>

<p>
"Oh dear!  I hope not," said Celia involuntarily.
</p>

<p>
"So do I," echoed Philip, significantly.
</p>

<p>
"But, Philip, I want to ask you one thing&mdash;are
you not a Protestant?"
</p>

<p>
"I?" asked Philip, with a peculiar intonation.  "No."
</p>

<p>
"You are a Papist?" said Celia, in a very
disappointed tone.
</p>

<p>
"No," said Philip again.
</p>

<p>
"Then what are you?" asked she, astonished.
</p>

<p>
"Neither&mdash;nothing," he answered, rather
bitterly.  "I am what half the men of this age are,
Sister Celia;&mdash;nothing at all.  I call myself a
Catholic, just to satisfy my mother; and when I
see her becoming doubtful of my soundness in her
faith, I go to mass with her half a dozen times, to
quiet her conscience&mdash;and perhaps my own.  But,
Catholic as I am&mdash;so far as I own to anything&mdash;I
do not believe you have read more Protestant
books, or heard more Protestant preaching, than I
have.  I have tried both religions in turn, and now
I believe in nothing.  I have lost all faith, whether
in religion, in morality, in man, or woman.  I see
the men of this city, Protestant and Catholic,
either bent on pursuing their own pleasures, or on
seeking their own interests&mdash;thinking of and
caring for themselves and nothing in the world else;
and I see the women, such as I have described
them to you.  I find none, of either faith, any
better than the rest.  What wonder, then, that the
fire of my faith&mdash;the old, bright, happy trust of my
childhood&mdash;has blackened and gone out?"
</p>

<p>
"But, Philip, dear Brother," pleaded Celia in
great pain, "surely you believe in God?"
</p>

<p>
"I believe in <i>nothing</i>," said he, firmly.
</p>

<p>
Celia turned away, grieved at her very heart.
</p>

<p>
"Listen to me, Celia," resumed Philip, now
quite serious.  "You will not betray me to my
mother&mdash;I see that in your eyes.  You see I can
believe in <i>you</i>," he added, smiling rather sadly.
"There was a time when I believed all that you
do, and more.  When I was a little child, I used
to think that, as Patient told me, God saw me, and
loved me, and was ready to be my Friend and
Father.  All that I noticed different from this in
the teaching of my other nurse, Jeannette Luchon,
was that she taught me to think this of the Virgin
Mary, my patron saint, and my guardian angel,
as well as of God.  Had I been struck deaf, dumb,
and blind at that time, I might have believed it all
yet.  Perhaps it would have been as well for me.
But I grew up to what I am.  I watched all these
highly religious people who visit here.  I heard
them invoke the Virgin or the saints to favor&mdash;not
to forgive, mind you&mdash;but, before its committal, to
prosper&mdash;what they admitted to be sin.  I saw my
own mother come home from receiving the Eucharist
at mass, and tell lies: I knew they were lies,
I was taught that it was very wicked in me to tell
lies, and also that, in receiving the Eucharist, she
had received Christ Himself into her soul.  How
could I believe both the one and the other?  I
was taught, again, that if I committed the most
fearful sins, a man like myself, sitting in a
confessional, could with two words cleanse my soul
as if I had never sinned.  How could I believe
that, when from that cleansing I came home and
found it no whit the cleaner?  I turn to
Protestantism.  I hear your preachers tell me that
'Without holiness no man shall see the Lord;'
that God has 'purer eyes than to behold sin;' and
many another passage to the like effect.  The next
week I hear that one of the pastor's flock, or
perhaps the very preacher himself, has been guilty
of some glaring breach of common honesty.  Does
the man mean me to believe&mdash;does he believe
himself&mdash;what he told me from the pulpit only a few
days earlier?  Romans and English, all are alike.
I find the most zealous professors of religion in
both communions guilty of acts with which I, who
profess no religion at all, would scorn to sully my
conscience.  I have seen only one man who seems
to me really honest and anxious to find out the
truth, and he is about where I am; only that his
mind is deeper and stronger than mine, and
therefore he suffers more."
</p>

<p>
"But Edward!"
</p>

<p>
"Oh, Edward!  He is a Protestant after your
own heart.  But he could not enter into my
feelings at all.  He is one of your simple, honest
folks, who believe what they are taught, and
do not trouble themselves about the parts of
the puzzle not fitting."
</p>

<p>
"Philip, I do not know what to say to you,"
answered his sister, candidly.  "I do not think we
ought to look at other people, and take our
religion from what they do, or do not do, but only
from God Himself.  If you would read the
Bible"&mdash;
</p>

<p>
"I have read it," he interrupted.
</p>

<p>
"And do you find nothing to satisfy you there?"
asked Celia, in surprise.
</p>

<p>
"I will tell you what I find.  Very ancient
writings, and very beautiful language, which I
admire exceedingly; but nothing upon which I
can rely."
</p>

<p>
"Not in God's Word?"
</p>

<p>
"How do I know that it is God's Word?  How
can I be sure that there is a God at all?"
</p>

<p>
Celia was silent.  Such questions had never
suggested themselves to her mind before, and she
knew not how to deal with them.  At length she
said&mdash;
</p>

<p>
"Philip, I believe in one God, who is my Father,
and orders all things for me; and who gave
His Son Jesus Christ to die for me, instead of my
dying for my own sins.  Is this so difficult to
believe?"
</p>

<p>
"I believe that you believe it," said Philip,
smiling.
</p>

<p>
"But you do not believe it yourself?" she asked,
with a baffled feeling.
</p>

<p>
"I have told you," he said, "that I believe
nothing."
</p>

<p>
"Philip," she answered, softly, "I do not
understand your feelings, and I do not know what
to say to you.  I must ask my Father.  I will lay
it before Him to-night; and as He shall give
me wisdom I will talk with you again."
</p>

<p>
So she closed the subject, not knowing that the
quiet certainty of conviction expressed in her
last words had made a deeper impression upon
Philip than any argument which could have been
used to him.
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
"Come in!" said Lady Ingram, that afternoon,
in reply to Celia's gentle tap at her door.  "I
thought it was you, <i>ma chère</i>.  I am glad you are
come, for I have something to say to you."
</p>

<p>
"Yes, Madam," responded Celia, resigning herself
to another lecture.
</p>

<p>
"When you have taken dancing-lessons for
a month, so that your deportment is a little
improved, I wish you to be present at my first
assembly for this year.  Do not be alarmed&mdash;I
require nothing more of you than to dress well
and sit still.  I shall present you to my particular
friends, saying that you do not yet speak French,
and none of them will then address you but such
as are acquainted with English.  You must
remain in a corner of the room, where your awkward
manners will attract no notice; and I shall put you
in Philip's charge, and desire him to tell you who
each person is, and so on.  You will then have the
opportunity of seeing really fine breeding and
distinguished manners, and can help in the
formation of your own accordingly, as you will
then understand what I require of you."
</p>

<p>
"Yes, Madam," said Celia again.
</p>

<p>
"I have ordered stuffs for you, and they
are now in the house.  My assembly will be
on Thursday week.  There is quite time enough to
make you one dress; and you will not appear
again until you are formed&mdash;at least, that is
my present intention.  Thérèse will take your
measure this evening, and cut out the dress, which
Patient can then make.  I wish you to have
a white satin petticoat and a yellow silk bodice
and train, guarded with lace; and I will lend you
jewels."
</p>

<p>
"Thank you, Madam," answered Celia, giving
herself up to all her step-mother's requirements.
</p>

<p>
"When you feel tired&mdash;I dare say you are not
accustomed yet to late hours&mdash;you may slip out of
the room and retire to you own apartments.
Nobody will miss you."
</p>

<p>
"No, Madam," meekly responded Celia again,
to this not very flattering remark.
</p>

<p>
"I think that is all I need say," pursued Lady
Ingram, meditatively.  "I do not wish to encumber
and confuse your mind with too many details,
or you will certainly not behave well.  I will
instruct Patient how you must be dressed, and I
will look at you myself before you descend to
the drawing-room, to be sure that no ridiculous
mistake has been made.  Thérèse shall dress your
hair.  Now help yourself to the chocolate."
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
"Patient! will you bring your work into my
closet?  I want to hear the end of your story."
</p>

<p>
"If you please, Madam.  I must try the skirt
on you in a little while, by your leave."
</p>

<p>
So Patient and the white satin petticoat came
and settled themselves in Celia's boudoir.
</p>

<p>
"You had just landed in France when you
left off, Patient.  I am anxious to know if you
found friends."
</p>

<p>
"'Twould make it a very long tale, Madam
to tell you of all that we did and suffered ere we
found friends.  It was a hard matter to see
what we should do; for had I sought a place
as woman to some lady, I could not have left
Roswith alone; and no lady would be like to take
the child with me.  So I could but entreat
the Lord to show me how to earn bread enough
for my wee sister and myself.  The woman of the
house who took us in after the shipwreck was
very good unto us, the Lord inclining her heart to
especial pity of us; and she greatly pressed us to
go on to Paris, where she thought we should
be more like to meet with succor.  Therefore we
set out on our way to Paris.  The Lord went with
us, and gave us favor in the eyes of all them whom
we had need of on our road.  Most of the women
whom we met showed much compassion for
Roswith, she being but a wee bit wean, and a very
douce and cannie bairn to boot.  It was in
the month of October that we arrived in Paris.
Here the Lord had prepared a strange thing
for us.  There was an uncle of Miss Magdalene,
by name Mr. Francis Grey, who was a rich gentleman
and a kindly.  He had been on his travels
into foreign parts, and was returning through this
city unto his place; and by what men call chance,
Miss Magdalene and I lighted on this gentleman
in the Paris street, we returning from the buying
of bread and other needful matters.  He was as if
he saw her not, for he afterward told us that he
had heard nought of the harrying of Lauchie, nor
of our shipwreck.  But she ran to him, and cast
her arms about him, calling 'Uncle Francis!' and
after a season he knew her again, but at first he
was a man amazed.  When he heard all that had
come upon us, and how Miss Magdalene was left
all alone in the world, father and mother being
drowned, he wept and clipped[<a id="chap05fn4text"></a><a href="#chap05fn4">4</a>] her many times,
and said that she should come with him to
his inn, and dwell with him, and be unto him as a
daughter, for he had no child.  Then she prayed
him to have compassion upon us also, Patient and
Roswith Leslie; who, as John saith, had continued
with her in her tribulation, and, it pleased her to
say, had aided and comforted her.  Mr. Francis
smiled, and he said that I, Patient, should be in
his service as a woman for her; and for Roswith,
'She,' quoth he, 'will not eat up all my substance,
poor wee thing!  So she shall come too, and
in time Patient must learn her meetly unto the
same place to some other lady.'  Thus it was,
Madam, that at the time when we seemed at
the worst, the Lord delivered us out of our
distresses."
</p>

<p>
"Then you went back to Scotland?"
</p>

<p>
"No, Madam, we never went back.  For when
Mr. Francis heard all, of the harrying of Lauchie,
and the evil deeds of the King's troopers, and the
cruelty of Claverhouse, he said there could be no
peace in Scotland more, and sent word unto his
steward to sell all, and remit the money to him.
He bought a house at Paris, and there we dwelt all."
</p>

<p>
"It was in her uncle's house, then, that my
mother met my father?"
</p>

<p>
"There, Madam.  Sir Edward took her to England,
for they married in January, 1687, while
King James yet reigned; and Sir Edward was great
with the King, and had a fine land there.  Her son,
your brother, Madam, that is Sir Edward now, was
born in London, in the summer of 1688."
</p>

<p>
"Patient, what kind of man was my father?"
</p>

<p>
"He was a very noble-looking gentleman, Madam,
tall, with dark eyes and hair."
</p>

<p>
"Yes, but I mean in his mind and character?"
</p>

<p>
"Well, Madam," answered Patient, rather
doubtfully, "he was much like other men.  He had
good points and bad points.  He was a kindly
gentleman, and open-handed.  He was not an angel."
</p>

<p>
"You scarce liked him, I think, Patient."
</p>

<p>
"I ought not to say so, Madam.  He was alway
a good and kind master to me.  Truly, he was not
the man I should have chosen for Miss Magdalene;
but I seldom see folks choose as I should in their
places.  Yet that is little marvel, since, fifteen
years gone, Patient Leslie made a choice that
Patient Irvine would be little like to make now."
</p>

<p>
Patient's dry, sarcastic tone warned Celia that
she had better turn the conversation.
</p>

<p>
"And where was I born, Patient?"
</p>

<p>
"Well, Madam, you know what happened that
summer your brother was born.  He that was
called Prince of Wales was born in the same
month;[<a id="chap05fn5text"></a><a href="#chap05fn5">5</a>] and in October King James fled away,
sending his wife Queen Mary[<a id="chap05fn6text"></a><a href="#chap05fn6">6</a>] and the babe to
France.  When King William landed, it was
expected that he would seize all belonging to the
malignants;[<a id="chap05fn7text"></a><a href="#chap05fn7">7</a>] this was not so entirely, yet so much
that Sir Edward was sore afeared to lose his.  He
kept marvellous quiet for a time, trusting that such
as were then in power would maybe not think of
him.  But when King James landed in Ireland, he
was constrained to join him, but he left my Lady
behind, and me with her, at his own house in
Cheshire.  After the battle of Boyne Water,[<a id="chap05fn8text"></a><a href="#chap05fn8">8</a>] whereat
he fought, it happed as he feared, for all his
property was escheated to the Crown.  At this
time Mr. Francis Grey came back into the country,
and for a time Sir Edward and my Lady abode
with him at a house which he had near the
Border, on the English side: but Sir Edward by his
work on the Boyne had made the place too hot
for to hold him, and he bethought himself of
escaping after King James to France.  So about
March, 1691, we began to journey slowly all down
England from the Border to the south sea.  Sir
Edward was mortal afeared of being known and
seized, so that he would not go near any place
where he could possibly be known: and having no
acquaintance anywhere in the parts of Devon,
made him fix upon Plymouth whence to sail.  It
was in the last of May that we left Exeter.  We
had journeyed but a little thence, when I saw that
my Lady, who had been ailing for some time, was
like to fall sick unto death.  I told Sir Edward
that methought she was more sick than he guessed,
but I think he counted my words but idle clavers
and foolish fancies.  At last she grew so very bad
that he began to believe me.  'Patient,' he said to
me one morn, 'I shall go on to Plymouth and
inquire for a ship.  Tend your Lady well, and so
soon as she can abide the journeying, she must
come after.  If I find it needful, I may sail the
first.'  It was on a Monday that Sir Edward rode
away, leaving my Lady and the little Master, with
me and Roswith to tend them, at a poor cot, the
abode of one Betty Walling."
</p>

<p>
"Betty Walling of Ashcliffe?  Why, Patient, I know her!"
</p>

<p>
"Do you so, Madam?  She knows you, I guess,
and could have told you somewhat anent yourself.
Not that she knew my Lady's name: I kept that
from her.  It was on the Friday following that you
were born.  Saving your presence, Madam, you
were such a poor, weak, puny babe, that none
thought you would live even a day.  Betty said, I
mind, 'Poor little soul! 'twill soon be out of its
suffering&mdash;you may take that comfort!'  I myself
never reckoned that you could live.  I marvel
whether Madam Passmore would remember Betty
Walling's coming unto her one wet even in June,
to beg a stoup of wine for a sick woman with her?
That sick woman was my dear Lady.  It was the
Saturday eve, and she died on the Sunday morning.
I laid her out for the burying, which was to
be on the Wednesday, and was preparing to go
thence unto Plymouth afterward, with Roswith and
the babes, when on the Tuesday night I was
aroused from sleep by a rapping on the window.
I crept to the casement and oped it, and was
surprised to hear my Master's voice saying softly,
'Patient, come and open to me.'  I ran then
quickly and let him in; he looked very white and
tired, and his dress soiled as if he had ridden hard
and long.  Quoth he, 'How fares Magdalene?'  As
softly as I could break it, I told him that she
would never suffer any more, but she had left him
a baby daughter which he must cherish for her
sake.  He was sore grieved as ever I saw man for
aught.  After a while, he told me much, quickly,
for there was little time.  He had not entered
Plymouth, when, riding softly in the dark, another
horseman met him, and aroused his wonder by
riding back after him and away again; and this he
did twice over.  At length the strange horseman
rode right up to him, and asked him plainly, 'Are
you Sir Edward Ingram, holding King James's
commission?'  And when he said he was, then
said the horseman, 'If you look to sail from
Plymouth, I would have you know that you are
expected there, and spies be abroad looking for you,
and you will be taken immediately you show
yourself.  If you love your life, turn back!'  Sir
Edward desiring to know both who he was and
how he knew this, the horseman saith, 'That I
may not tell you: but ride hard, or they will be on
your track; for they already misdoubt that you
are at Ashcliffe, where if your following be, I
counsel you to remove thence with all the speed
that may be.'  Sir Edward said that he had
ridden for life all through three days and nights,
and now we must move away without awaiting
aught.  'And we will go,' quoth he, 'by Bideford;
for they will expect me now, if they find
I have given them the slip, to take passage
by Portsmouth or Southampton, and will scarce
count on my turning westward.'  It grieved us
both sore to leave my Lady unburied, but there
was no help; and Betty passed her word to
follow the body, and see that she was meetly laid in
her grave.  'And how will I carry the babe?'
quoth I.  'Nay, truly,' said he, sorrowfully, 'the
babe cannot go with us; it will bewray all by its
crying.  We must needs leave it somewhere at
nurse, and when better times come, and the King
hath his own again, I will return and claim it.'  For
Master Edward was a braw laddie, that scarce
ever cried or plained; while you, Madam, under
your leave, did keep up a continual whining and
mewling, which would have entirely hindered our
lying hid, or journeying under cover of darkness.
So I called Betty when it grew light, and conferred
with her; and she said, 'Leave the babe at the
gate of the Hall, and watch it till one cometh to
take it.'  Madam Passmore, she told us, was a
kindly gentlewoman, that had sent word she
would have come to see my Lady herself if she
also had not been sick; and at this time having
a little babe of her own, Betty thought she would
be of soft heart unto any other desolate and needful
babe.  So I clad you in laced wraps, and pinned
a paper on your coat with a gold pin of my Lady's,
and Sir Edward wrote on the paper your name,
'Celia,' the which my poor Lady, as she lay a-dying,
had felt a fancy to have you called.  He said
he had ever wished, should he have a daughter, to
name her Grissel, which was my Lady his mother's
name; 'But,' quoth he, 'if my poor Magdalene in
dying had asked me to name the child Nebuchadnezzar,
I would not have said her nay.'  He was
such a gentleman as that, Madam; in his deepest
troubles he scarce could forbear jesting.  So I
carried you to the Hall, and laid you softly down at
the gate, and rang the bell, and hid and watched
among the trees.  There first the Master rode up,
looked strangely on you, though pitifully
enough, but touched you not: and anon came out
a kindly-looking woman of some fifty-and-five or
sixty years, and took you up, and carried you away
in her arms, chirping pleasantly unto you the
while.  So I was satisfied for the babe."
</p>

<p>
"That was Cicely Aggett," said Celia, smiling:
"dear old Cicely! she told me about her finding
me."
</p>

<p>
"The next hour," pursued Patient, "saw us
thence.  We got safe to Bideford, and away, the
Lord aiding us, and after some tossing upon the
sea, landed at Harfleur in fourteen days thereafter.
Thence we came up to Paris, unto Mr. Francis
Grey's house, which he had given unto my Lady
in dowry; and Sir Edward bought another house
at St. Germains, for he had had prudence to put
some of his money out to interest in this land, so
that all was not lost."
</p>

<p>
"And now tell me, Patient, how did he meet my
step-mother?"
</p>

<p>
"I must pray you to leave that, Madam, for
the time, and try on this skirt.  Thérèse hath given
me the pieces for the bodice."

behave to people?"
</p>

<p>
"If you please, Madam, I do in England, but I
don't know about France," said Celia, in some
trepidation as to what her step-mother might
require of her.

<p>
"Absurd!" said Lady Ingram.  "Good manners
are the same everywhere, and etiquette very
nearly so.  Now, how many courtesies would you
make to a Viscountess?"
</p>

<p>
"I should only make one to anybody, Madam,
unless you tell me otherwise."
</p>

<p>
"<i>Incroyable</i>!  I never saw such a lamentable
want of education as you show.  You have no
more fine breeding than that stove.  Now listen,
and remember: to a Princess of the Blood you
make three profound courtesies, approaching a
little nearer each time, until at the last you
are near enough to sink upon your knees, and
kiss her hand.  To a Duchess, not of the Blood,
or a Marchioness, three courtesies, but less
profound, and not moving from your place.  To a
Countess or Viscountess, two; to any other person
superior or equal to yourself, one.  Inferiors,
of course, you will not condescend to notice.  Do
you understand, and will you remember?"
</p>

<p>
"I will do my best, Madam, but I am afraid I
shall forget."
</p>

<p>
"I believe you will, first thing.  Now listen
again: I expect to-night the Duchesses of
Longueville and Montausier, the Marchioness de
Simiane, and other inferior persons.  What kind
of seat will you take?"
</p>

<p>
"Will you please to instruct me, Madam?"
asked Celia, timidly&mdash;an answer which slightly
modified Lady Ingram's annoyance.
</p>

<p>
"You are very ignorant," said that Lady.  "It
is one comfort that you are willing to be taught.
My dear, when we are merely assembled <i>en famille</i>,
and there is no etiquette observed, you can sit on
what you like.  But if there be any person present
in an assembly of higher rank than yourself, you
must not sit on a chair with a back to it; and
whatever be the rank of your companions, on
no occasion must you occupy an arm-chair.  You
will take your place this evening on an ottoman or
a folding-stool.  You will remember that?"
</p>

<p>
"I will remember, Madam," replied Celia.
</p>

<p>
"Should any member of the Royal House
condescend to honor me by appearing at my
assemblies&mdash;I do not expect it to-night&mdash;you will
rise, making three deep courtesies, and remain
standing until you are desired to seat yourself."
</p>

<p>
"Yes, Madam."
</p>

<p>
"Very well.  Now go down into the drawing-room,
and find a stool somewhere in the corner,
where nobody will see you."
</p>

<p>
Thus graciously dismissed, Celia retired from
her step-mother's dressing-room, with a long look
at Lady Ingram, whom she had never before seen
so splendidly attired.  She wore a blue robe, with
a long sweeping train, robe and train being
elaborately embroidered with flowers, in white,
crimson, and straw-color; a petticoat of the palest
straw-colored satin, a deep lace berthe, and sleeves
of lace reaching to the elbow; long white gloves
advanced to meet the sleeve, and jewels of sapphire
and diamond gleamed upon the neck and wrists.
Her hair was dressed about a foot above her head,
and adorned with white plumes, sapphires, and
diamonds.  Celia descended to the drawing-room,
feeling stiff and uncomfortable in her new yellow
silk and white satin, and nervously afraid of losing
her bracelets and necklace, of topaz and diamonds,
which Lady Ingram had lent her for the occasion.
In the drawing-room she discovered Mr. Philip
resplendently arrayed in white and crimson, and
occupied in surveying himself intently in the
mirrors.
</p>

<p>
"O Celia!" said he, when she uttered his name,
"I am glad you have come early.  It is such fun
to see the folks come in, and do all their bowing
and courtesying; and I shall have some amusement
to-night in watching your innocent astonishment
at some things, my woodland bird, or I am
mistaken.  Please be seated, Madam; here is a
place for you in a nice little corner, and I shall
keep by your side devotedly all the evening.  Has
my Lady-Mother seen and approved that smart
new gown of yours?"
</p>

<p>
Celia smiled, and answered affirmatively.
</p>

<p>
"That is a comfort!" quoth Mr. Philip.  "Now,
I liked the looks of you a good deal better in that
brown cashmere.  But I am an absolute nobody,
as you will find very shortly, if you have not done
so already."
</p>

<p>
"The brown cashmere will go on again to-morrow,
and I shall not be sorry for it.  But,
Philip"&mdash;
</p>

<p>
"Stop! look out&mdash;somebody is coming."
</p>

<p>
A gentleman in dark blue led in a lady very
elaborately dressed in pink.  As they entered
by one door, Lady Ingram came forward to receive
them from another.  She stood and made three
courtesies, to which the lady in pink responded
with one.  Then Lady Ingram came forward, and,
taking the hand of her guest, turned to Celia and
Philip in the corner.
</p>

<p>
"<i>Bon soir, ma tante</i>," observed the latter
unceremoniously from his station behind Celia's chair.
</p>

<p>
"Celia, this is my sister, the Duchess de
Montausier," Lady Ingram condescended to say;
and Celia, rising, made two low courtesies, having
already forgotten the number of reverences due.
</p>

<p>
"Three," whispered Philip, too low to be
overheard, thus saving his sister a scolding.
</p>

<p>
The Duchess returned the compliment with
a single courtesy, Celia thought a rather distant
one.  But her astonishment had not yet left
her at the meeting between the sisters.
</p>

<p>
"Is that really your aunt?" she asked of
Philip.
</p>

<p>
"Yes, my mother's sister," answered Philip,
smiling.  "Why?"
</p>

<p>
"They courtesied so!" was Celia's ungrammatical
exclamation.
</p>

<p>
"Ah! you think it unsisterly?  The one, my
dear, is a Duchess, the other only the widow of a
Baronet.  You must not consider the sistership."
</p>

<p>
Celia laughed within herself to think how the
Squire and Madam Passmore would look, if they
saw her and Isabella courtesying away at each
other in that style.
</p>

<p>
"Now don't lose all these folks," resumed
Philip, as more people entered.  "That little man
dressed in black, with a black wig, to whom my
mother is courtesying now,&mdash;do you see him?"
</p>

<p>
"I was just looking at him," replied Celia.  "I
cannot say that I like him, though I have no idea
who he may be."
</p>

<p>
"Why?&mdash;because he is so short?"
</p>

<p>
"Oh no!  I hope I should never dislike a man
for any natural infirmity.  I thought he looked
very cross."
</p>

<p>
"He has the happy distinction of being the
crossest man in France," said Philip.
</p>

<p>
"Well, he looks like it," said Celia.
</p>

<p>
"But one of the most distinguished men in
France, my dear.  That is the great Duke de Lauzun,[<a id="chap06fn1text"></a><a href="#chap06fn1">1</a>]
who has spent ten years in prison for treason,
who aspired to the hand of Mademoiselle, the
King's own cousin, and whom King James trusted
to bring the Queen and the Prince of Wales over
here from England."
</p>

<p>
"I wonder he trusted him," observed Celia.
</p>

<p>
"I never wonder at anything," philosophically
answered Mr. Philip Ingram.  "Now look to your
right!  Do you see the lady in black, with fair
hair, and blue eyes, who seems so quiet and
uninterested in all that is passing?"
</p>

<p>
"I think I do."
</p>

<p>
"That is a cousin of my mother's, who would
not have appeared here if it had not been a family
assembly.  She is a Jansenist.  Thirty years ago
she was a famous beauty, and a very fashionable
woman.  Now all that is over."
</p>

<p>
"What is a Jansenist, Philip?"
</p>

<p>
"Ah! there you puzzle me.  I thought you
would want to know that.  You had better ask my
Cousin Charlotte&mdash;she can tell you much better
than I can."
</p>

<p>
"I do not like to speak to any one," said Celia,
timidly.  "Can you not tell me something about
them?"
</p>

<p>
"Well, this much I can tell you&mdash;they are very
bad people, who lead uncommonly holy lives&mdash;ergo,
holiness does not make a saint."
</p>

<p>
"Philip, you are laughing at me."
</p>

<p>
"No, my dear; I am laughing at the Catholic
Church, not at you.  The Jansenists are a sort
of heretic-Catholics, whom all real Catholics agree
to call very wicked.  They hold all manner of
wrong doctrines, according to the Bishops and
my Lady-Mother; and they lead lives of such
austerity and purity as to put half the saints
in the calendar to shame.  Now this very Cousin
Charlotte of mine, who sits there looking so quiet
and saintly, with her blue eyes cast down, and her
hands folded on that sombre black gown,&mdash;when
my mother was a girl, she was the gayest of the
gay.  About fifteen years since she became a
Jansenist.  From that day she has been a very saint.
She practices all kinds of austerities, and is
behaved to almost as if she were a professed nun.
Of course, in the eyes of all true Catholics,
her Jansenism is her worst and wickedest action.
I don't quite see myself how anything can be so
very wrong which makes such saints of such
sinners.  But you see I am a complete <i>extern</i>, as the
religious call it."
</p>

<p>
"I should like to know something more about
these people, Philip.  What doctrines do they
hold?"
</p>

<p>
"Now, what a remarkable attraction anything
wrong and perilous has for a woman!" observed
Mr. Philip Ingram, with the air of a philosopher.
"Well, my dear, I have only heard one; but I
believe they have a sort of confession or creed,
indicating the points whereon they differ from the
Church.  That one is, that there is no such thing
as grace of congruity, and that men are saved by
the favor of God only, and by no merit of their
own."
</p>

<p>
"But, Philip, that is the Gospel!" exclaimed
Celia, turning round to look at him.  "That is
what we Protestants believe."
</p>

<p>
"Is it, my dear?  Well, I have no objection.
(Now, return to your condition of a statue, or you
will have a lecture on awkwardness and want of
repose in your manners.  Oh!  I know all about
that.  Do you think I was born such a finished
courtier as you see me?)  As to merit, I have
lived long enough to find out one thing, and that
is, that people who are always talking of merit are
generally least particular about acquiring it, while
those who believe that their good deeds are worth
nothing, have the largest stock of them."
</p>

<p>
"That is natural," said Celia, thoughtfully.
</p>

<p>
"Is it?" asked Philip again.  "Well, it looks
like the rule of contrary to me.  But you see I
have no vocation.  Now look at the lady who
stands on my mother's left&mdash;the one in primrose.
Do you see her?
</p>

<p>
"I see her," said Celia.  "I like her face better
than some of the others.  Who is she?"
</p>

<p>
"The Marchioness de Simiane,[<a id="chap06fn2text"></a><a href="#chap06fn2">2</a>] daughter of the
Countess de Grignan, and granddaughter of the late
clever Marchioness de Sévigné.  Her flatterers call
her an angel.  She is not that, but I don't think
she is quite so near the other set of ethereal
essences as a good many of the people in this
room."
</p>

<p>
"What an opinion you have of your friends,
Philip!"
</p>

<p>
"My friends, are they?" responded Philip, with
a little laugh.  "How many of them do you
suppose would shed tears at my funeral?  There is
not one of them who has a heart, my dear&mdash;merely
lumps of painted stone, as I told you.  These are
not men and women&mdash;they are only walking statues."
</p>

<p>
"Do you call that cross little man a walking
statue?" asked Celia, smiling.
</p>

<p>
"He!&mdash;scarcely; he is too intensely disagreeable."
</p>

<p>
"I should rather like to see the lady to whom
you said that man took a fancy, Philip.  Is she
here?"
</p>

<p>
"Ah! my Sister," answered Philip, in a graver
voice than any in which he had yet spoken, "you
must go to the royal vaults at St. Denis, and
search among the coffins, to do that.  She was
buried twenty years ago.[<a id="chap06fn3text"></a><a href="#chap06fn3">3</a>]  She was so unfortunate
as to have a heart, and he has a piece of
harder marble even than usual.  So when the
two articles met, the one broke the other."
</p>

<p>
"I never can tell whether you are jesting or
serious, Philip."
</p>

<p>
"A little of both generally, my dear.  Don't
lose those ladies who are going through the
courtesying process now&mdash;they are distinguished
people.  The elder one is the Duchess du Maine,[<a id="chap06fn4text"></a><a href="#chap06fn4">4</a>]
one of the daughters of the Prince of Condé, who
is emphatically '<i>the</i> Prince' in French society.
The younger is Mademoiselle de Noailles,[<a id="chap06fn5text"></a><a href="#chap06fn5">5</a>] the
daughter of the Duke de Noailles&mdash;a famous belle,
as you may see.  She will probably be disposed of
in a year or two to some Prince or Duke&mdash;whoever
offers her father the best lump of pin-money.
We don't sell young ladies in the market here, as
they do in Barbary; we manage the little affair in
private.  But 'tis a sale, for all that."
</p>

<p>
"It sounds very bad when you look at it in that
light, Philip."
</p>

<p>
"A good many things do so, my dear, when you
strip off the gilding.  His Majesty gave a cut of
his walking-stick once to a gentleman with whom
he was in a passion, and was considered to have
honored him by that gracious notice.  Now, if he
had been the Baron's son, and the other the King,
whipping to death would have been thought too
good for him after such an insult to Majesty.  We
live in a droll world, my Sister."
</p>

<p>
"But, Philip, there must be differences between
people&mdash;God has made it so."
</p>

<p>
"Aren't there?&mdash;with a vengeance!  On my
word, here comes Bontems, the King's head
<i>valet-de-chambre</i>.  Now we shall have some fun.  You
will learn the kind of differences there are between
people&mdash;Louis XIV. and you, to wit."
</p>

<p>
"What do you mean by fun?"
</p>

<p>
"You shall hear.  Here is a chair, Monsieur
Bontems, and I am rejoiced to see you."
</p>

<p>
"Sir, I am your most obedient servant," responded
a dapper little gentleman, dressed in
black and silver, with a long sword by his side,
and large silver buckles in his shoes.  He sat
down on the seat which Philip indicated.
</p>

<p>
"I trust that His Most Christian Majesty enjoys
good health this evening?" began that young
gentleman, with an air of the greatest interest in the
reply to his question.
</p>

<p>
"Sir, I am happy to say that His Majesty
condescends to be in the enjoyment of most excellent
health."
</p>

<p>
"Very condescending of him, I am sure," commented
Philip, gravely.  "May I venture to hope
that His Royal Highness the Duke de Berry[<a id="chap06fn6text"></a><a href="#chap06fn6">6</a>] is
equally condescending?"
</p>

<p>
"Sir," answered Monsieur Bontems, looking
much grieved, "I regret exceedingly to state that
Monseigneur the Duke is not in perfect health.
On the contrary, he has this very day been
constrained to take medicine."
</p>

<p>
"How deeply distressing!" lamented Mr. Philip
Ingram, putting on a face to match his words.
"And might I ask the kind of medicine which had
the felicity of a passage down Monseigneur's most
distinguished throat, and the honor of relieving
his august sufferings?"
</p>

<p>
"Sir," answered Monsieur Bontems, not in the
least perceiving that he was being laughed at, "it
was a tisane of camomile flowers."
</p>

<p>
"I unfeignedly trust that it has not affected his
illustrious appetite?"
</p>

<p>
"Sir," was the reply, always commencing by the
same word, "I am much troubled at the remembrance
that His Royal Highness's appetite at supper
was extremely bad.  He ate only two plates of
soup, one fowl, fifty heads of asparagus, and a
small cherry tart."
</p>

<p>
"Ah! it must have been very bad indeed," said
Mr. Philip, with a melancholy air.  "He generally
eats about a couple of geese and half a dozen
pheasants, does he not?"[<a id="chap06fn7text"></a><a href="#chap06fn7">7</a>]
</p>

<p>
"Sir?" said Monsieur Bontems, interrogatively.
"I am happy to say, Sir, that all the members of
the Royal House have tolerably good appetites;
but scarcely&mdash;two geese and six pheasants!&mdash;no,
Sir!"
</p>

<p>
"Yes, I have gathered that they have, from
what I have heard you say," answered Philip,
gravely.  "Monsieur Bontems, I am anxious to
inform my sister&mdash;who speaks no French&mdash;of the
manner in which His Majesty is served throughout
the day.  I am not sure that I remember all points
correctly.  It is your duty, is it not, to present His
Majesty's wig in the morning, and to buckle his
left garter?"
</p>

<p>
"The left, Sir?" asked Monsieur Bontems,
somewhat indignantly.  "The right!  Any of His
Majesty's ordinary valets may touch the left&mdash;it is
my high office to attend upon the august right leg
of my most venerated Sovereign!"
</p>

<p>
"I beg your pardon a hundred thousand times!"
</p>

<p>
"You have it, Sir," said Monsieur Bontems
affably.  "A young gentleman who shows so much
interest in His Majesty's and Monseigneur's health
may be pardoned even that.  But you are a little
mistaken in saying 'buckle.'  His Majesty is
frequently pleased to clasp his own garters; it is my
privilege to unclasp them in the evening."
</p>

<p>
"Would you kindly explain to me, that I may
translate to my sister, His Majesty's mode of life
during each day?"
</p>

<p>
"Sir, I shall have the utmost pleasure," replied
Monsieur Bontems, laying his hand Upon his heart.
"Madam," he continued, addressing himself to
Celia, though she could understand him only through
the medium of Philip, "first thing in the morning,
when I rise from the watch-bed which I occupy in
the august chamber of my Sovereign, having
noiselessly dressed in the antechamber, I and Monsieur
De St. Quentin, first gentleman of the chamber,
reverently approach his royal bed, and presume to
arouse our Sovereign from his slumbers.  Then
Monsieur De St. Quentin turns his back to the
curtains, and placing his hands behind him, respectfully
presents the royal wigs, properly curled and
dressed, for His Majesty's selection."
</p>

<p>
"Pardon my interrupting you; I thought the
King's attendants never turned their backs upon
him?"
</p>

<p>
"Sir, His Majesty cannot be seen without a wig!
Profanity!" cried Monsieur Bontems, looking horrified.
"This is the only part of our service in which
we are constrained to turn our ignoble backs upon
our most illustrious Master."
</p>

<p>
"I beg your pardon, and understand you now.
Pray proceed."
</p>

<p>
"When the King has selected the wig which he
is pleased to wear, St. Quentin puts away the
others; and then, His Majesty placing his wig on
his august head with his own royal hands, he
indicates to me by a signal that he is ready for the
curtains to be undrawn.  As soon as I have
undrawn the curtains, there is the familiar <i>entrée</i>.
This is attended by the Princes of the Blood, and
by His Majesty's physicians.  Then I pour into the
hands of my Sovereign a few drops of spirits of wine,
and the Duke d'Aumont,[<a id="chap06fn8text"></a><a href="#chap06fn8">8</a>] first Lord of the Bedchamber,
offers the holy water.  Now His Majesty rises,
and I present his slippers.  After putting on his
dressing-gown, if it be winter, His Majesty goes to
the fire.  The first <i>entrée</i> follows.  The King shaves
on alternate days.  Monsieur De St. Quentin has the
high honor of removing the royal beard, and washing
with spirits of wine and water our Sovereign's
august chin.  I hold the glass, while His Majesty
wipes his face with a rich towel.  Then, while His
Majesty's dresses, the <i>grande entrée</i> takes place.
His Most Christian Majesty is assisted in dressing
by the Grand Master of the Robes, Monsieur d'Aumont,
a Marquis (graciously chosen by the Sovereign),
Monsieur De St. Quentin, my humble self,
three valets, and two pages.  Thus, as you will see,
many attendants of the Crown are allowed the felicity
of approaching near to the person of our most
illustrious Master."
</p>

<p>
"Too many cooks spoiling the broth, I should
say," was the translator's comment.  "Fancy ten
people helping a fellow to put his coat on!"
</p>

<p>
"His Majesty's shoes and garters are clasped
with diamonds.  At this point the king
condescends to breakfast.  On an enamelled salver a
loaf is brought by the officers of the buttery, and a
folded napkin on another: the cup-bearer presents
to the Duke d'Aumont a golden cup, into which he
pours a small quantity of wine and water, and the
second cup-bearer makes the assay.  The goblet,
carefully rinsed and replenished, is now presented
to His Majesty upon a golden saucer.  The napkin
is offered by the first Prince of the Blood present
at the <i>entrée</i>.  His Majesty then intrusts to my
hands the reliquary which he wears about his neck,
and I carefully pass it to one of the lower attendants,
who carries it to the royal closet, and remains there
in charge of it.  The royal shirt is then presented&mdash;by
the Grand Master of the Robes, if no person
of more distinction be present; but if any more
august persons have attended the <i>entrée</i>, it is passed
on till it reaches the first Prince of the Blood.  I
assure you, on frosty winter days, I have known it
perfectly cold on reaching His Majesty (though
always carefully warmed), the persons of distinction
through whose hands it had to pass being so
numerous."
</p>

<p>
"Ah!  'Pride costs more than hunger, thirst, or
cold,'" observed Mr. Philip Ingram.  "That is a
copy I had set me ages ago.  But what a very
cool proceeding!"
</p>

<p>
"When His Majesty's lace cravat is presented,
he is pleased himself to indicate the person who
shall have the honor of tying it.  Then I bring him
the overcoat which he wore on the previous day,
and with his own august hands he removes from
the pockets such articles as he is pleased to retain.
Lastly, Monsieur De St. Quentin presents to him,
on an enamelled salver, two handkerchiefs laced
with superb point.  Now His Majesty returns to his
<i>ruelle</i>[<a id="chap06fn9text"></a><a href="#chap06fn9">9</a>] for his private devotions.  Two cushions are
placed there, upon which His Majesty condescends
to kneel.  Here he prays aloud, all the Cardinals
and Bishops in the chamber following his royal
accents in lower tones."
</p>

<p>
"I hope he learns his prayers by heart, then, or
all his Cardinals following will put him out
abominably!" was the interpolation this time.
</p>

<p>
"Oh dear, Philip!" murmured Celia, "it reminds
me of Daniel and Darius."
</p>

<p>
"'Save of thee, O King?'[<a id="chap06fn10text"></a><a href="#chap06fn10">10</a>]  No, he is a little
better than that."
</p>

<p>
"Our Sovereign," pursued Monsieur Bontems,
"now receives the envoys of foreign powers, not
one of which powers is worthy to compete with
our august Master."
</p>

<p>
"I say, draw that mild!" objected Mr. Philip Ingram.
</p>

<p>
"Then he passes into his cabinet, and issues his
orders for the day; when all retire but the Blood,
and a few other highly distinguished persons.
After an interval of repose, His Majesty attends
mass."
</p>

<p>
"How sadly he must want his repose!"
</p>

<p>
"After mass, and a visit to the council-chamber,
at one o'clock His Majesty dines.  This is either
<i>au petit couvert</i>, or <i>au grand couvert</i>; the <i>grands
couverts</i> are rare.  His Majesty commonly dines
alone in his own cabinet, at a small table, three
courses and a dessert being served.  Monsieur de
St. Quentin announces the repast, and His Majesty
takes his seat.  If the Grand Chamberlain be
there, he waits on the Sovereign; when he is
absent, this is the privilege of Monsieur de
St. Quentin.  Another interval of repose ensues before
His Majesty drives out.  He frequently condescends
at this time to amuse himself with his
favorite dogs.  Then he changes his dress, and
drives or hunts.  On returning, he again changes
his attire, and after a short period in his cabinet,
repairs to the apartments of Madame de Maintenon,
where he remains until ten, the hour of
supper.  At a quarter past ten His Majesty enters
the supper-room, during which interval the officers
have made the assay"&mdash;
</p>

<p>
"What is the assay?" asked Celia of Philip, who
repeated the question.

"The assay," said Monsieur Bontems, condescending
to explain, "is the testing of different
matters, to see that no attempt has been made
upon the most sacred life of His Majesty.  There
is the assay of the plates, which are rubbed with
bread and salt; the knife, the fork, the spoon, and
the toothpicks, which will be used by our
Sovereign.  All these are rubbed with bread and salt,
afterwards eaten by the officers of the assay, to
make sure that no deleterious matter has been
applied to these articles.  Every dish brought to
the royal table is tested by the officers ere it may
be set before His Majesty, and the dishes are
brought in by the comptroller-general, an officer of
the pantry, a comptroller of the buttery, and an
equerry of the kitchen, preceded and followed by
guards, whose duty it is to prevent all manner of
tampering with the meats destined for the King."
</p>

<p>
"Poor man!" said Celia, compassionately; "I
am glad to be beneath all that caution and preparation."
</p>

<p>
"This done," proceeded Monsieur Bontems,
"the house-steward enters, with two ushers
bearing flambeaux.  Then comes His Most Christian
Majesty.  All the Princes and Princesses of France
are already standing round the table.  His
Majesty most graciously desires them to be seated.
Six nobles stand at each end of the table.  When
His Majesty condescends to drink, the cup-bearer
cries aloud, 'Drink for the King!' whereupon the
officers of the cellar approach with an enamelled
goblet and two decanters.  The cup-bearer pours
out, the officers taste.  The cup-bearer presents
the goblet to the Sovereign, and as he raises it
with his illustrious hand to his august lips, the
cup-bearer cries aloud, 'The King drinks!' and the
whole company bow to His Majesty."
</p>

<p>
"What a tremendous bore it must be!" was Mr. Philip's
comment.  "How can the poor fellow ever
get his supper eaten?"
</p>

<p>
"His Majesty commonly begins supper with
three or four platesful of different soups.  Some
light meat follows&mdash;a chicken, a pheasant, a
partridge or two&mdash;then a heavier dish, such as beef
or mutton.  The King concludes his repast with a
few little delicacies, such as salad, pastry, and
sweetmeats.[<a id="chap06fn11text"></a><a href="#chap06fn11">11</a>]  When he wishes to wipe his hands,
three Dukes and a Prince of the Blood present him
with a damp napkin; the dry one which follows I
have the honor to offer.  His Majesty usually
drinks about three times during supper."
</p>

<p>
"How much at a time?" inquired Philip, with
an air of deep interest.
</p>

<p>
"Sir," replied Monsieur Bontems, gravely, "His
Majesty's custom in this respect somewhat varies.
The goblet holds about half-a-pint, and the King
rarely empties it at a draught."
</p>

<p>
"A pint and a quarter, call it," said Philip,
reflectively.
</p>

<p>
"After supper, His Majesty proceeds to his
bedchamber, where he dismisses the greater number of
his guests; he then passes on to his cabinet,
followed by the Princes and Princesses.  About
midnight he feeds his dogs."
</p>

<p>
"Does he feed them himself?"
</p>

<p>
"Sir, there are occasions upon which those
indescribably happy animals have the honor of
receiving morsels from His Majesty's own hand.
The King now returns to his bed-chamber, and the
<i>petit coucher</i> commences.  An arm-chair is
prepared for him near the fire, and the <i>en-cas</i> is
placed upon a table near the bed.  This is a small
repast, prepared lest it should be His Majesty's
pleasure to demand food during the night.  It is
most frequently a bowl of soup, a cold roast fowl,
bread, wine, and water."
</p>

<p>
"And how many Dukes are required to give him those?"
</p>

<p>
"Sir, my humble services are esteemed sufficient."
</p>

<p>
"He appears to be much less august at some
moments than others," satirically remarked the
translator.
</p>

<p>
"When our Sovereign enters his chamber, he
hands to me his watch and reliquary, and delivers
to Monsieur d'Aumont his waistcoat, cravat, and
ribbon.  Two valets and two pages assist us in the
removal of the garments honored by His Majesty's
wear.  When the King is ready, I lift the candle-stick,
and deliver it to the nobleman indicated by
my Sovereign for that unparalleled honor.  All
persons now quit the chamber save the candle-bearer,
the physician, and myself.  His Majesty
selects the dress which he will wear the next
morning, and gets into bed."
</p>

<p>
"Can he get into bed by himself?  I should
have thought it would have required five Dukes
and ten Marquises to help him."
</p>

<p>
"After the physician has visited his august
patient, he and the candle-bearer retire; I close
the curtains, and, turning my back to the royal
couch, with my hands behind me, await the pleasure
of my Sovereign.  It is to me that he delivers
the wig, passing it outside the curtain with his own
illustrious hand.  I now extinguish the candles,
light the night-lights, and take possession of the
watch-bed."
</p>

<p>
"I wonder if you don't occasionally faint under
such a weight of honor&mdash;and bother," observed
Mr. Philip Ingram, not to Monsieur Bontems.
"Well, now we have got His Most Christian
Majesty in bed, let him stay there.  Monsieur
Bontems, I am unspeakably indebted to you for
your highly-interesting account, and shall never
forget it as long as I live.  I beg you will not allow
me to detain you further from the company, who
are earnestly desirous of your enchanting conversation,
though less sensible of your merits than I am."
</p>

<p>
Monsieur Bontems laid both hands upon his
heart, and made three bows.
</p>

<p>
"Sir, I beg you will not depreciate your high
qualities.  Sir, I take the utmost delight in
conversing with you."
</p>

<p>
And the head-valet of the chamber allowed
himself to be absorbed among the general throng.
</p>

<p>
"Well, is he not a comical specimen?" said
Philip to Celia.  "He often makes me laugh till I
am exhausted; and the beauty of it is that he
never finds out at what one is laughing.  And to
think who it is that they worship with all these
rites&mdash;an old man of seventy-four, with one foot in
the grave, who has never been any better than he
should be.  Really, it reminds one of Herod
Agrippa and them of Tyre and Sidon!"[<a id="chap06fn12text"></a><a href="#chap06fn12">12</a>]
</p>

<p>
"'Thou shalt honor the face of the old man,'"[<a id="chap06fn13text"></a><a href="#chap06fn13">13</a>]
whispered Celia, softly.
</p>

<p>
"My dear," said Philip, "I don't complain of
their honoring him.  Let them honor him as much
as they like&mdash;he is their King, and they ought to
do.  But what we have just heard is not honoring
him, to my thinking&mdash;it is teasing and worshipping
him.  I assure you I pity the poor fellow
with all my heart.  He must have a most
uncomfortable time of it.  No, if I were to envy any
man, it would not be Louis XIV."
</p>

<p>
"Who would it be, Philip?" asked Celia, with a
smile.
</p>

<p>
"Simeon Stylites, perhaps," said Philip, drily.
"I would quite as soon be the one as the other!"
</p>

<p>
"I don't know who he was," replied Celia.
</p>

<p>
"A gentleman of the olden time, who worked
out his salvation for forty years on the top of a
tall pillar," was the answer, accompanied by an
expression of countenance which Celia had seen
before in Philip, and could not understand.  "Are
you tired?" he added, suddenly.
</p>

<p>
"Scarcely, yet," she answered; "it is all so new
to me.  But what time is it, Philip?"
</p>

<p>
Philip pulled out a watch about three inches in
diameter.
</p>

<p>
"Ten minutes to one."
</p>

<p>
"Do you mean to say it is one o'clock in the
morning?" asked Celia, in a voice of unmitigated
amazement and horror.
</p>

<p>
"It certainly is not one o'clock in the afternoon,"
replied Philip, with much gravity.
</p>

<p>
"I had no idea how late it was!  Let me go,
Philip, please do."
</p>

<p>
And Celia made her escape rather hastily.  But
Lady Ingram was not justified in saying that
nobody would miss her, as she would have seen if
she had noticed the lost and <i>ennuyé</i> look of
Mr. Philip Ingram after the disappearance of Celia.

THE NIGHT BOSWITH DIED.
</h3>

<p class="poem2">
  "Thou art not weary, O sweet heart and glad!<br />
  Ye are not weary, O ye wings of light!<br />
  Ye are not weary, golden-sandalled feet<br />
  And eyes lift up in Heaven.  Were we with thee,<br />
  We never should be weary any more.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem2">
  So sleep, sweet love, and waken not for us.<br />
  Ah! wake not at my cry, which is of earth,<br />
  For thou these twenty years hast been of Heaven.<br />
  Still not thy harp for me: I will wail low,<br />
  That my voice reach thee not beyond the stars.<br />
  Only wait for me, O my harper! since<br />
  When thou and I have clasped hands at the gate,<br />
  We never shall be weary any more."<br />
</p>

<p><br /><br /></p>

<p>
"O Patient!  I am very sorry to have kept
you up so late as this&mdash;I had no idea that
you would wait for me!" exclaimed Celia, as,
hastening into her bedroom, she found Patient quietly
at work beside the fire.
</p>

<p>
"I should have done that, Madam, at whatever
hour you had returned," was Patient's answer, as
she helped Celia to unclasp her topaz and
diamond ornaments, and put them away carefully in
their cases.  "I thought you were early; my Lady
often does not quit her assemblies till day-dawn."
</p>

<p>
"You see," responded Celia, a little apologetically,
awaking to the fact that Patient had not
expected her for another hour or two, "I am so little
accustomed to these things.  I never was up at
such an hour as this before."
</p>

<p>
"All the better for you, Madam," said Patient,
quietly.
</p>

<p>
"You do not like these assemblies?"
</p>

<p>
"I have nothing to do with them, Madam."
</p>

<p>
"But if you had," persisted Celia, looking for
Patient's opinion as a sister in the faith.
</p>

<p>
But Patient seemed scarcely willing to impart it.
</p>

<p>
"You command me to answer you, Madam?"
she said.
</p>

<p>
"I want to know, Patient," replied Celia, simply.
</p>

<p>
"'What concord hath Christ with Belial?'"
answered Patient.  "Madam, when I was but a
young maid, I looked on the world as divided into
many sects&mdash;Covenanters, Independents, Prelatists,
Anabaptists, and the like, and I fancied that
all who were not Covenanters (as I was) must
needs be more or less wrong.  Methinks I am
wiser now.  I see the world as divided into two
camps only, and the army wherein I serve hath
but one rallying-cry.  They that believe, and they
that believe not&mdash;here are the camps, 'What
think ye of Christ?'&mdash;that is the rallying-cry.  I
see the Church as a great school, holding many
forms and classes, but only one Master.  And I think
less now of a fellow-scholar sitting on another form
from mine, and seeing the other side of the Master's
face, if I find that he heareth His voice, and
followeth Him.  Madam, what think you all those
great ladies down-stairs would say, if you asked
them that question&mdash;'What think ye of Christ?'[<a id="chap07fn1text"></a><a href="#chap07fn1">1</a>]  Poor
souls! they never think of Him.  And with
them in the enemy's camp I have nought to do, so
long as they remain there."
</p>

<p>
"But may we not win them over to our side?"
queried Celia.
</p>

<p>
"Ah! my dear young lady!" answered Patient,
rather sadly, "I have seen that question lead
many a disciple astray who did run well.  When
a man goes over to the enemy's ground to parley,
it ends at times in his staying there.  Methinks
that it is only when we carry the Master with us,
and when we go like the preachers to the poor
savages in the plantations, that we have any hope
of doing well.  'Tis so easy to think, 'I go there
to please God,' when really we only go to please
ourselves."
</p>

<p>
Patient remained silent for a few minutes, but
said presently&mdash;
</p>

<p>
"The Sabbath afore the harrying of Lauchie,
Madam, which was Communion Sabbath, Mr. Grey
preached a very rich discourse from that
word, 'He hath made with me an everlasting
covenant.'[<a id="chap07fn2text"></a><a href="#chap07fn2">2</a>]  After, fencing the tables, he spake
from that other word of Paul, 'Ye are Christ's.'[<a id="chap07fn3text"></a><a href="#chap07fn3">3</a>]  And
in speaking on one head&mdash;he dividing his
discourse into thirty-seven points wherein believers
are Christ's&mdash;he said one word which hath stuck
in mine heart since then.  'We are all vastly
readier,' quoth he, 'to try to follow the Master in
the few matters wherein He acted as God, and
therefore beyond us, than in the multitude wherein
He did act as our ensample.  For an hundred
who would willingly follow unto the Pharisee's
feasting, there is scarce one who is ready to seek
out sinners, saying unto them, "Go, and sin
no more."'[<a id="chap07fn4text"></a><a href="#chap07fn4">4</a>]  Whereupon he took occasion to
reprove them among his flock that were of
too light and unstable a nature, loving overmuch,
gadding about and taking of pleasure.  I was then
a young maid, and truly was somewhat exercised
with that discourse, seeing that I loved the
customs yearly observed among us on the 1st day
of November, which the Papistical folk called
Hallowe'en."
</p>

<p>
"What customs, Patient?"
</p>

<p>
"Divers light and fantastical vanities, Madam,
which you were no better to hear tell of,&mdash;such
like as burning of nuts with names to them,
and searching of eggs brake into glasses, for
the discovering of fortunes: which did much
delight me in my tender age, though now I know
that they be but folly if not worse.  Moreover,
they would throw apples in tubs of water, and the
laddies and lassies, with their hands tied behind,
would strive to reach them by mouth, and many
other siccan fooleries."
</p>

<p>
"It sounds rather amusing, Patient."
</p>

<p>
"So it might be, Madam, for we bairns which
were of too small age for aught less foolish.  But
for us, who are members of Christ's body, and
have heard His voice and followed Him, what have
we to do with the deeds of this weary and evil
world, which we cast off when we arose to follow
Him?  Maybe I had better not have said this unto
you, Madam, seeing that (saving your presence)
you are yet but a young maid, and youth is
naturally desirous of vain delights.  When you
are a little further on in the way, the Lord will
teach it you Himself, even as He hath taught me."
</p>

<p>
"To tell you the truth, Patient, while I quite see
with you in the main, I think you a little severe in
the particular."
</p>

<p>
"I do not doubt it, Madam.  The Lord knoweth
how to deaden your heart unto this world, and He
can do it a deal better than I.  But if you be His
(the which I doubt not), it must needs be."
</p>

<p>
"I have scarce a choice now," said Celia, in a
low voice, feeling doubtful how far she ought
to make any remark to Patient which might seem
to reflect on Lady Ingram.
</p>

<p>
"That I perceive, Madam," answered Patient,
in the same tone.  "Only&mdash;if you will condescend
to pardon the liberty I take in saying it&mdash;take
heed that the pleasing and obeying of man clash
not with the pleasing and obeying of God.  'For
all that is in the world&mdash;the lust of the flesh, and
the lust of the eye, and the pride of life&mdash;is not of
the Father, but is of the world.'"[<a id="chap07fn5text"></a><a href="#chap07fn5">5</a>]
</p>

<p>
"Patient, there is one thing which I feel very
much here&mdash;the want of a Protestant service."
</p>

<p>
"I used to feel that very sore, Madam.  Not
that I miss it not now, 'specially at times: yet
scarce, me thinks, so sadly as I once did.  At first I
was much exercised with that word, 'Forsake not
the assembling of yourselves together;'[<a id="chap07fn6text"></a><a href="#chap07fn6">6</a>] and
I marvelled whether I ought to remain in this
place.  But I began to think that it was not I that
had forsaken mine own land, but the Lord which
hath caused me to be cast out thence; I having,
moreover, passed a solemn word to my dear Lady
when she lay a-dying, that I would not leave
Master Edward his lone in this strange land while
he was yet a bairn.  Then me thought of some
words of Mr. Grey in that last sermon he ever
preached.  'A soldier,' quoth he, 'hath no right to
choose his position.'  So now, seeing that since
the Dragonnades, as they called the persecution
here, there is no worship permitted to be had, and
also that the Lord, and not I, hath placed me
here, I am content.  Every Sabbath, ay, every
day, He preacheth unto me in the Word, and
there is no finer discourse than His."
</p>

<p>
"What persecution, Patient?" asked Celia, as
she lay down on her pillow.  "This King hath
never been a persecutor, hath he?"
</p>

<p>
"Ay hath he, Madam.  The morn, if it please
you, I will tell you some stories of the
Dragonnades.  My Lady hath given me further work to
do for you; and if you think meet, I can bring my
sewing into your closet as aforetime."
</p>

<p>
"Pray do, Patient: I like your stories.  Good-night."
</p>

<p>
"Good-night, Madam, and the Lord be with you!"
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
"Your very obedient servant, Mrs. Celia
Ingram," observed Mr. Philip, lounging into his
sister's boudoir the next morning.  "I hope your
early rising has done you no harm."
</p>

<p>
"I rose at my usual hour, which is six."
</p>

<p>
"I rose at <i>my</i> usual hour, which is nine."
</p>

<p>
"O Philip!" cried Celia, laughing.
</p>

<p>
"Well, now, what earthly inducement have I to
rise earlier?  I am doomed&mdash;for my sins, I
suppose&mdash;to spend four mortal hours of every day in
dressing, breakfasting, dining, and supping.
Moreover, I am constrained to ride a horse.  <i>Item</i>,
I have to talk nonsense.  Fourth and lastly, I am
the docile slave of my Lady-Mother.  Is there
anything in the list I have just given you to make
a fellow turn out of bed three hours before he can't
help it?"
</p>

<p>
"I should not think there was, except in the
last item."
</p>

<p>
"Not in the last item, Madam, seeing that her
gracious Ladyship does not shine upon the world
any sooner than I do&mdash;have you not discovered
that yet?"
</p>

<p>
"It seems to me, Philip, that you want something
to do."
</p>

<p>
"Well, that depends," said Philip, reflectively.
"It might be something I should not relish."
</p>

<p>
"Well!" said Celia, a trifle scornfully, "I never
would lead such a useless life as that, Philip.  1
would either find something to do or make it."
</p>

<p>
"How very like a woman you talk!" loftily
remarked Mr. Philip Ingram, putting his hands in
his pockets.
</p>

<p>
Celia laughed merrily.
</p>

<p>
"I don't like it, Celia," resumed Philip, more
seriously, "but what can I do?  I wish exceedingly
that my mother would let me go into the
army, but she will not.  Edward, you know&mdash;or
you don't know&mdash;is a Colonel in King James's
army; so that he can find something to do.  I
wish you would talk to my mother about it."
</p>

<p>
"<i>I!</i>" echoed Celia, in an unmistakable tone.
</p>

<p>
"You," repeated her brother.
</p>

<p>
"My dear Philip, you surely very much mistake
my position with her.  I have no more influence
with my Lady Ingram than&mdash;than her little pug dog."
</p>

<p>
"A precious lot, then," retorted Mr. Philip,
"for if anybody ruffled the tip of Miss Venus's
tail, they would not be asked here again for a
twelvemonth.  It is you who mistake, Mrs. Celia.
The only way to manage my mother is to stand
up to her&mdash;to let her know that you can take your
own way, and you will."
</p>

<p>
"Neither you nor I have any right to do that,
Philip," replied Celia, gravely.
</p>

<p>
"I have not, that I allow," said Philip.  "I don't
quite see that as regards you.  Her Ladyship is
not <i>your</i> mother."
</p>

<p>
"I think that she takes to me the place both of
father and mother, and that I have no more right
to argue with or disobey her than them."
</p>

<p>
"That is your view, is it?" inquired Philip,
meditatively.  "Well, if you look at it in that way,
of course you cannot ask her.  So be it, then.  I
must be contented, I suppose, with my customary
and highly useful mode of life."
</p>

<p>
"I find no lack of occupation," observed Celia.
</p>

<p>
"No, you are a woman," said Philip.  "And
as Patient's old rhyme (of which I never can
remember the first line) says, 'Woman's work is
never done.'  Women do seem to possess a
marvellous and enviable faculty of finding endless
amusement in pushing a needle into a piece of
linen, and pulling it out again&mdash;can't understand
it.  Oh! has my mother told you that we are
going to St. Germains next week?"
</p>

<p>
"No," said Celia, rather surprised.
</p>

<p>
"Then there is a piece of information for you."
</p>

<p>
"She expects me to go, I suppose?"
</p>

<p>
"If you don't I won't," said Mr. Philip Ingram,
dogmatically.
</p>

<p>
"Is the&mdash;the&mdash;Court"&mdash;began Celia, very hesitatingly.
</p>

<p>
"Is the Pretender there?  Come out with it
now&mdash;I shall not put my fingers in my ears.  Yes,
Madam, the Pretender is there, and his mother
too, and all the rest of them."
</p>

<p>
"Oh!" sighed Celia, much relieved.  "I thought
you would be a Jacobite."
</p>

<p>
"You are a Whig, then, Mrs. Celia?" asked
Philip in an amused tone.
</p>

<p>
"I do not know that I am a politician at all,"
she answered; "but I was brought up to the
Whig view."
</p>

<p>
"All right!" said Mr. Philip, accommodatingly.
"Don't let my mother know it&mdash;that is all."
</p>

<p>
"I think my father&mdash;Squire Passmore, I mean"&mdash;Celia
explained, a little sadly, "told her so much
at our first meeting."
</p>

<p>
"So much the better.  And you expected to
find me a red-hot Jacobite, did you?  To tell the
truth, I don't care two pins about it; neither does
my mother, only 'tis the mode here, and she has
taken it up along with her face-washes, laces, and
lutestring.  Of course I would not call the King
anything but 'Your Majesty' to his face&mdash;it would
hurt his feelings, poor gentleman, and I don't see
that it would do any good.  But if you ask me
whether I would risk the confiscation of my
property (when I have any) in aiding a second
Restoration,&mdash;why, not I."
</p>

<p>
"Do you consider yourself an Englishman or a
Frenchman, Philip?"
</p>

<p>
"Well, upon my word, Mrs. Celia Ingram, you
are complimentary!  'Do I consider myself an
Englishman or a Frenchman!'  I am an Englishman,
Madam, and proud of it; and I will thank
you not to insult me by asking me whether I
consider myself a Frenchman!"
</p>

<p>
"I beg your pardon, dear Philip," replied Celia,
laughing.  "But you have never been in England,
have you?"
</p>

<p>
"Never&mdash;I wish I had."
</p>

<p>
"What is the Pretender like, Philip?"
</p>

<p>
"Well, Madam, the Jacobites say he would be
only and wholly like his father, if he were not so
very like his mother: while you Whigs are of
opinion that he resembles some washerwoman at
Egham, or bricklayer at Rotherhithe&mdash;don't
remember which, and doesn't matter."
</p>

<p>
"But what, or whom, do you think him like?"
</p>

<p>
"Not very like his mother, in my judgment,
which is very unbiased, except in his height, and
the shape of his hands and mouth.  Still, I should
not call him unlike her.  Of his likeness to his
father I can say nothing, for I don't remember
King James, who died when I was only eight years
old.  The son is a very tall man&mdash;there is over six
feet of him, I should say&mdash;with a long face, nearly
oval,&mdash;dark eyes, rather fine,&mdash;and a pleasant,
good-natured sort of mouth."
</p>

<p>
"Is he a pleasant man to speak to?  Does he
talk much?"
</p>

<p>
"To the first question&mdash;yes; he is by no means
without brains, and is very gracious to strangers.
To the second&mdash;no, very little.  If you are looking
for me, Thérèse, in your wanderings up and down,
here I am, at her Ladyship's service."
</p>

<p>
"It is not her Ladyship, Sir, dat want you.
Dupont tell me to say you dat Monsieur Colville
is in your rooms."
</p>

<p>
"Colville! that is jolly!"
</p>

<p>
And Mr. Philip Ingram took his immediate
departure.  Celia guessed that Mr. Colville was the
solitary friend of whom he had before spoken.
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
"Now, Patient, I want to hear about the
Dragonnades.  Oh! surely you are not making up all
those dresses for me?"
</p>

<p>
"Yes, Madam," answered Patient, in her passive
way.  "My Lady has ordered it."
</p>

<p>
"Well," sighed Celia, "I wonder when I am to
wear them?"
</p>

<p>
Patient gathered up one of the multifarious
dresses&mdash;a blue gauze one&mdash;and followed her
mistress into the boudoir.
</p>

<p>
"You have never seen King Louis, Madam?"
</p>

<p>
"Never; I should like to have a glimpse of him
some day."
</p>

<p>
"I never have, and I hope I never shall."
</p>

<p>
"Do you think so badly of him, Patient?"
</p>

<p>
"They call him The Great: methinks they
might fitly give the same title to the Devil.  He is a
man with neither heart nor conscience.  God forbid
that I should judge any man: yet 'tis written,
'By their fruits ye shall know them,'[<a id="chap07fn7text"></a><a href="#chap07fn7">7</a>] and the
fruits of this King are truly dreadful.  It doth
look as if the Lord had given him 'over to a
reprobate mind, to do those things which are not
convenient.'[<a id="chap07fn8text"></a><a href="#chap07fn8">8</a>]  Privately, he is a man of very evil
life; and publicly&mdash;you will hear shortly, Madam,
what he is.  'Tis now, methinks, nigh upon twenty
years since what they called the Edict of Nantes[<a id="chap07fn9text"></a><a href="#chap07fn9">9</a>]
was done away with.  That decree, passed by
some former King of this country,[<a id="chap07fn10text"></a><a href="#chap07fn10">10</a>] did permit all
the Protestants to hold their own worship, and to
be visited in sickness by their chosen ministers.
This, being too gentle for this King, he therefore
swept away.  His dragoons were sent into every
place throughout France, with orders to force the
the poor Protestants to go unto the wicked mass,
and to harry them in all manner of ways, saving
only to avoid danger of their lives.  One Sabbath
thereto appointed, they drave all in every place to
mass at the point of their swords, goading and
pricking on such as lagged, or showed ill-will
thereto.  I saw one crowd so driven, from a
window&mdash;for my Lady being a Papist, kept safe them
in her house: or else it was that I was not counted
worthy of the Lord to have that great honor of
suffering for His sake.  Poor souls! white-headed
men there were, and tender women, and little,
innocent, frightened children.  It was a sight to
move any human heart.  I heard many a tale of
worse things they did.  Breaking into the houses,
destroying and burning the household furniture,
binding and beating the men, yea, even the women;
drumming with hellish noise in the chambers of
the sick, until they swooned away or were like to
die; burning the houses of some and the workshops
of others: all this we heard, and more."
</p>

<p>
"Patient, how dreadful!" said Celia.  "Why,
'tis near what they did in the days of Queen
Mary."
</p>

<p>
"They only went a little further then on the
same road&mdash;that was all, methinks," answered
Patient, calmly.  "When the Lord readeth in the
Books before men and angels the stories of the
persecutions in England and in Scotland, He will
scarce forget the Dragonnades of France."
</p>

<p>
"I did not know that there had been any
persecution in Scotland, Patient&mdash;except what King
Charles did; I suppose that was a sort of persecution."
</p>

<p>
"Did you not, Madam?" asked Patient, quietly
turning down a hem.  "I was not thinking of
King Charles, but of the earlier days, when tender
women like Helen Stirk and Margaret Wilson
perished in the waters, and when the bloody
Cardinal brent Master George Wishart, that true
servant of God and the Evangel, in his devil's-fire at
St. Andrews."
</p>

<p>
"I never heard of all those people, Patient."
</p>

<p>
"Ay, perchance so, Madam.  I dare say their
names and their sufferings scarce went beyond
their own land," replied Patient, in a constrained
voice, as if her heart were a little stirred at last.
"But the Lord heard of them; and Scotland
heard of them, and rose and bared her arm, and
drave forth the men of blood from off her soil.
The Lord is their Avenger, at times, in this
life&mdash;beyond this life, always."
</p>

<p>
"Tell me something more about them, Patient.
Who was Master Wishart?"
</p>

<p>
"He was a Scottish gentleman of good birth, a
Wishart of Pitarrow, Madam, who, giving himself
up unto the service of God and the Evangel, in
Dundee and other towns, and bringing the blessed
Word and the blessed hope unto many a poor
hungered soul, was seized by the bloody Cardinal
Beaton, and brent to death as the reward of his
labors, in the year of our Lord, 1546.  They that
did know him at that time, and Master John Knox
afterward, did say unto divers persons, as I have
heard, that even Master John was not fit to stand
up with George Wishart.  He was a true man,
and one that spake so good and sweet words as
did move the hearts of such as heard him.  I think
the Lord knew how to ease him after his sore pain,
and that, now that he hath had rest in Heaven for
one hundred and seventy years, he accounts not
that he bare too much for the Lord's sake, that
one bitter hour at St. Andrew's."
</p>

<p>
"And who was Helen&mdash;what did you say her
name was?&mdash;and Margaret Wilson?"
</p>

<p>
"Helen Stirk, Madam, was a wife that was
permitted to die along with her guidman for the
name of the Lord, which she counted a grand
mercy.  I can tell you a little more concerning
Margaret Wilson, for she died no so long since, and my
father's sister's son, Duncan M'Intyre, saw her die.
It was at Wigtown, on the 11th of May, in the
year that King James became King.  Duncan had
business in the town, where some of his kith on his
father's side dwelt; and hearing that two women
were to be put to death, he, like a hare-brained
callant as he was, was set on seeing it.  I heard
not much about Margaret Maclauchlan, who
suffered at the same time, save that she was the
widow of one John Millikan, a wright of
Drumjargan, and a woman notable for her piety and
discretion.  But that of Maggie Wilson took much
effect upon mine heart, seeing that she was a
young maid of just eighteen years, mine own age.
She and Agnes her sister, as Duncan told us, were
children of one Gilbert Wilson of Glenvernoch,
who with his wife were Prelatists.  Maggie and
Agnes, who were not able to conform unto the ill
Prelatical ways wherein their father and mother
were entangled, had joined many meetings of the
Covenanters on the hill-sides or in the glens, for
preaching or prayer."
</p>

<p>
"How old was Agnes?  Was she a married woman?"
</p>

<p>
"No, Madam; she was younger than Maggie&mdash;a
maid of thirteen years."
</p>

<p>
"But, Patient!  I never heard of such a thing&mdash;two
girls, thirteen and eighteen, setting themselves
up to judge their parents' religion, and choosing a
different one for themselves!" said Celia, in
astonishment, for she could not help thinking of the
strong expletives which would have burst from
Squire Passmore, if she and Lucy had calmly
declared themselves Presbyterians, and declined
to accompany that gentleman to church as usual.
</p>

<p>
"Madam, their father and mother were Prelatists,"
said Patient, evidently of opinion that this
settled the question.  "They could not go with
them to church and read the mass-book."
</p>

<p>
"Oh! you mean they were Papists?"
</p>

<p>
"No, Madam&mdash;Prelatists," repeated Patient, a
little perversely.  "Not that I see much disagreement,
indeed, for methinks a Prelatist is but a
Papist with a difference.  Yet I do trust there be
Prelatists that will be saved, and I can scarce think
that of Papists."
</p>

<p>
"I don't understand you, Patient.  I suppose
these Prelatists are some sect that I have not
heard anything about," said Celia, with much
simplicity, for she never supposed that Patient's
stern condemnation was levelled against her own
Church, and would have been sorely grieved and
bewildered had she known it.  "Go on, if you
please."
</p>

<p>
Patient did not explain, and proceeded with her
history.
</p>

<p>
"When the late King James became King, on
the death of his brother, he put forth a proclamation
granting liberty of conscience unto all sects
whatsoever.  For a time the Puritans rejoiced in
this mercy, thinking it a favor unto them, but later
they became aware that 'twas but a deceit to
extend ease unto the Papists.  Maggie and Agnes
Wilson, the which were in hiding, did shortly after
this proclamation venture into the town, being
wishful to speak with their kinsfolk.  They never
reached their kith, being betrayed by one Patrick
Stewart, who came upon them with a band of men,
and lodged them in the thieves' hole.  Thence
they were shifted to another chamber, wherein
Margaret Maclauchlan already abode.  Thomas
Wilson, their brother, did strive to set them free,
thereby but harming himself;[<a id="chap07fn11text"></a><a href="#chap07fn11">11</a>] and they were had
up afore the Sheriff,[<a id="chap07fn12text"></a><a href="#chap07fn12">12</a>] and the Provost,[<a id="chap07fn13text"></a><a href="#chap07fn13">13</a>] and some
others.  The indictment of them was for attending
field-conventicles, and for joining in the rebellion
at Bothwell Bridge and Airsmoss,&mdash;they, poor
feeble souls, never having been near the same
places.  The jury brought the charge in proven,
and the three women were doomed to be justified[<a id="chap07fn14text"></a><a href="#chap07fn14">14</a>]
by water.  They were to be tied to stakes below
the mark of the tide, in the water of Blednoch,
near Wigtown, until they should be dead, the tide
sweeping over them in its flow.  Howbeit the Lord
restrained them of having their will upon the
young maid Agnes.  Maybe they were nigh shamed
to justify such a bairn: however, they tarried in
her case.  But on the day appointed, which, as I
said, was May 11th, one named Windram, being in
command over a band of soldiers, did hale
Margaret Maclauchlan and Margaret Wilson to the
place of execution.  The first stake, whereto
Margaret Maclauchlan was tied, was fixed much deeper
in the bed of the river than the other, they hoping
that Maggie Wilson should be feared at her death,
being the sooner, and so brought to recant.  Moreover,
one of the town officers did with his halbert
press and push down the poor old wife, who,
having the lesser suffering of the two, was soon
with the Lord.  As she strave in the bitterness of
death, quoth one to Maggie Wilson, 'What think
ye of that?'  'Nay,' quoth she, 'what do I see but
Christ in one of His members struggling there!'  Then
Maggie, bring tied unto the nearer stake,
after singing of a Psalm,[<a id="chap07fn15text"></a><a href="#chap07fn15">15</a>] did read a chapter of the
Word,[<a id="chap07fn16text"></a><a href="#chap07fn16">16</a>] and prayed, so that all might hear.  And
while she was a-praying, the water overflowed her.
And to see the devilish cruelty of these men! they
left her till she was nigh dead, and then, lifting her
out of the water, did use all care and means to
recover her, as if they meant mercy.  But it was
but that she might die over again.  They murdered
her twice over&mdash;poor, poor maid! for she was past
feeling when they got her out.  Then, when she
could speak, this Windram did ask her if she would
pray for the King.  Much cause they had given
her!  She then answered that she wished the
salvation of all men, and the damnation of none.
Then a maid which stood by Duncan, and had
sobbed and wept aforetime, which he thought must
be of kin or friendly unto her, did cry most
dolefully, 'Dear Margaret! oh say, "God save the
King!" say, "God save the King!"'  'God save
him if He will,' quoth she, 'for I desire his
salvation.'  Windram now drawing near, commanded
her to take the oath unto the King, abjuring of the
Solemn League and Covenant.  'I will not,' quoth
she; 'I am one of Christ's children.'  No sooner
had she thus spoken, than one of the town's officers
with his halbert thrust her back into the water,
crying, 'Tak' anither drink, my hearty!'  So she
died."
</p>

<p>
"Patient!" said Celia, in a low, constrained
voice, "did God let those men go scathless?"
</p>

<p>
"Not so, Madam.  The town's officer that thrust
her back was ever after that tormented with a
thirst the which no draught could slake; and for
many generations the children of the other, which
kept down the old wife with his halbert, were all
born with misshapen hands and feet."[<a id="chap07fn17text"></a><a href="#chap07fn17">17</a>]
</p>

<p>
"Patient," said Celia again, in the same low
reverent tone, "I wonder that He suffers such
things to be!"
</p>

<p>
"I marvelled at that, Madam, years agone.  It
seemed very strange unto me that He suffered us
to be haled down to the beach at the harrying of
Lauchie, and that the storm should come on us
and cut off so many lives of His servants.  It
exercised me very sore."
</p>

<p>
"And how did you settle it, Patient?"
</p>

<p>
"I do not know that I should have settled it,
Madam, had I not met with an ancient gentleman,
a minister, that used at one time to visit Mr. Francis
in Paris here.  He was a reverend man by the
name of Colville, one of mine own country, that
had fled out of Scotland of old time, and had been
dwelling for many years in Switzerland and Germany."
</p>

<p>
"Was he akin to this Mr. Colville who is Philip's
friend?"
</p>

<p>
"This young gentleman is his grandson, Madam;
and little good he doth Mr. Philip, I fear.
If he were a wee bit more like his grandsire, I
would be fain.  Howbeit, grace goeth not by
inheritance, as I know.  He was a very kindly
gentleman, Madam, this old minister; and when
he had sat a while ben with Mr. Francis and Miss
Magdalene, he oft would say, 'Now let me go but
and speak unto the Leslies.'  And one day&mdash;ah! that
day!&mdash;when Roswith was very ill, I asked of
him the thing which did exercise me.  And he
said unto me, gently and kindly, holding mine
hand in his quavering hand, for he was a very
ancient gentleman,&mdash;'Dear child,' quoth he, 'dost
thou know so little thy Father?  Thou mindest
me of my little son,' saith he, 'when the fire brake
out in mine house.  When I hasted up into his
chamber, which was above the chamber a-fire, and
tare the blankets from his bed, and haled him
thence somewhat roughly, the bairn greet, and
asked of me what made me so angry.'  Well, I
could not choose but smile to think of the babe's
blunder; and he saith, 'I see thou canst understand
that.  Why, dear child,' quoth he, 'thou art
about just the same blunder as my bairn.  Thy
Father sendeth a messenger in haste to fetch thy
soul home to Him; and lo! "Father," sayest
thou, "why art thou so angry?"  We are all little
children,' quoth he, 'and are apt to think our
Father is angry when He is but short with us
because of danger.  And dost thou think, lassie,' he
said, 'that they which saw the face of God first
thing after that storm, rebuked Him because He
had fetched them thither by water?'  So then I
saw mine error."
</p>

<p>
"Did this old gentleman teach you a great deal,
Patient?  I keep wondering whence you have all
the things you say to me.  I don't think such
things as you do; and even Cicely Aggett, who is
some twenty years older than you, does not seem
to know half so much about God as you do.
Where do you get your thoughts and your knowledge?"
</p>

<p>
"Where the Lord doth mostly teach His children,
Madam&mdash;'by the rivers of Babylon, where I sat
down and wept.'[<a id="chap07fn18text"></a><a href="#chap07fn18">18</a>]  I think he that beareth the
precious seed commonly goeth forth weeping,[<a id="chap07fn19text"></a><a href="#chap07fn19">19</a>] for
we cannot enter into the troubles and perplexities
of others which have known none ourselves.  And
if it behoved <i>Him</i> in all things to be made like
unto His brethren, that He might be a merciful
and faithful High Priest,[<a id="chap07fn20text"></a><a href="#chap07fn20">20</a>] who are we that we
should grudge to be made like unto our brethren
likewise?  That is a deep word, Madam,&mdash;'Though
He were a Son, yet learned He obedience
by the things which He suffered.'[<a id="chap07fn21text"></a><a href="#chap07fn21">21</a>]  I have not got
half down to the bottom of it yet.  But for the
matter of that, I am but just hoeing at the top of
all Scripture, and scarce delving any depth."
</p>

<p>
"Well, Patient," said Celia, with a perplexed,
melancholy air, "if you think you are but hoeing
on the surface, what am I doing?"
</p>

<p>
"My dear bairn&mdash;I ask your pardon, Madam,"
corrected Patient.
</p>

<p>
"Don't ask it, Patient," replied Celia, softly; "I
like that&mdash;it sounds as if somebody loved me."
</p>

<p>
"Eh, lassie!" said Patient, suddenly losing all
her conventionality, and much of her English,
"did ye no think I loved Miss Magdalene's bairn?
I was the first that ever fed you, that ever dressed
you, that ever bare you about.  I was just fon' on
you when you were a bit baby."  Patient's voice
became suddenly tremulous, and ceased.
</p>

<p>
Celia rose from her chair, and kneeling down by
Patient's side, threw her arms round her neck and
kissed her.  Patient held her tight for a moment.
</p>

<p>
"The Lord bless you, my ain lassie!" she
faltered, "You are just that Miss Magdalene o'er
again&mdash;her ain brown eyes, and her smile, and her
soft bit mou'!  The Lord bless you!"
</p>

<p>
Celia resumed her seat, and Patient her calm,
respectful tone; but the former understood the
latter a great deal better after that episode, and
never forgot what a wealth of love lay hidden
under that quiet manner and somewhat stiff
address.
</p>

<p>
"Well, Patient, what were you going to say to me?"
</p>

<p>
"I scarce think, Madam, that you have had
much dwelling by the waters of Babylon as yet.
I don't mean that you have had no sorrow at all:
I misdoubt if any man or maid ever grew up to
your age without knowing what sorrow was.  But
there are griefs and griefs; and 'tis one thing to
visit a town, and another to abide there.  David
knew what it was: 'My tears have been my meat
day and night,'[<a id="chap07fn22text"></a><a href="#chap07fn22">22</a>] quoth he.  And though in the
main I conceive that and many another word in
David's Psalms to point unto Him that was greater
than David, yet I dare say 'twas no pleasant
dwelling in the cave with all them that were bitter
of soul, neither fleeing on the mountains afore King
Saul, nor yet abiding in Gath.  He felt them all
sore crosses, I little doubt."
</p>

<p>
"Do you think that is what our Lord means,
Patient, where He says, 'Take up the cross, and
follow Me'?"[<a id="chap07fn23text"></a><a href="#chap07fn23">23</a>]
</p>

<p>
"I think he means whatsoever is undelightful
to flesh and blood, that cometh in the way of
following Him.  Is the gate strait? yet 'Follow
Me.'  Is the way narrow? yet 'Follow Me.'  Art
thou faint, and cold, and an-hungered, and a-weary?
Yet 'Follow Me.'  'My grace is sufficient for
thee.'[<a id="chap07fn24text"></a><a href="#chap07fn24">24</a>]  My footsteps are plain before thee, My eye
is ever over thee.  'Follow Me.'"
</p>

<p>
"But, Patient, don't you think that sometimes
the footsteps are not so very plain before us?"
</p>

<p>
"We cannot see them when we don't look for
them, Madam&mdash;that is certain."
</p>

<p>
"Ah! but when we do&mdash;is it not sometimes very
difficult to see them?"
</p>

<p>
"Madam, blind eyes cannot see.  We are all
blind by nature, and even they that are God's
children, I believe, cannot sin but it dims their
eyes.  Even of them, perchance more 'see men as
trees walking.'[<a id="chap07fn25text"></a><a href="#chap07fn25">25</a>] than as having the full use of their
spiritual eyes.  Well, it matters little how we see
men, if only we have eyes to see Christ.  Yet
which of us, after all, ever really hath seen Him?
But anent crosses, Madam, I have a word to say,
if you please.  There's a wonderful manufactory
of crosses ever a-working among all God's saints.
Whatever else we are unskilful in, we are
uncommon skilled in making of rods for our own backs.
And very sharp rods they are, mostly.  I had a
deal sooner with David, 'fall into the hand of the
Lord' than into the hands of men:[<a id="chap07fn26text"></a><a href="#chap07fn26">26</a>] but above all,
may the Lord deliver me from falling into mine
own!  There is a sharp saying, Madam, which
maybe you have heard,&mdash;'He that is his own
lawyer hath a fool to his client:' I am sure he that
ruleth his own way hath a fool to his governor.
Yet every man among us would be his own God if
he might.  What else are all our murmurings and
disputings of the will of the Lord?"
</p>

<p>
"But, Patient, you don't call grieving murmuring?
You would not say that every cry of pain
was a murmur?  Surely when God uses His rod
to us, He means us to feel it?"
</p>

<p>
"Certainly, Madam, He means us to feel it;
else there were no use laying it on us.  There
is a point, doubtless, where grieving doth become
murmuring; and where that is the Lord knoweth
better than we.  He makes no mistakes.  He will
not account that murmuring which he that crieth
doth not intend to be such.  I think He looks on
our griefs not as they be to Him, nor perchance to
others, but as they are to us; just as a kindly
nurse or mother will comfort a little bairn greeting
over a bit plaything that none save itself
accounted the losing of worth naming."
</p>

<p>
"We are very foolish, I am afraid, sometimes,"
said Celia, thoughtfully.
</p>

<p>
"Foolish! ay we are so!" returned Patient.
"Setting our hearts, like Jonah, on bit gourds,
that grow up in a night, and are withered in a
night[<a id="chap07fn27text"></a><a href="#chap07fn27">27</a>]&mdash;quarrelling with the Lord when His
wisdom denies us our own will&mdash;mewling and
grumbling like ill bairns, as we be, at a breath of wind
that crosses us&mdash;saying, all of us at our hearts, 'I
am, and none else beside me'[<a id="chap07fn28text"></a><a href="#chap07fn28">28</a>]&mdash;'Who is the Lord,
that I should obey Him?'[<a id="chap07fn29text"></a><a href="#chap07fn29">29</a>]  The longer I live,
Madam, the more I am ever marvelling at the
wonderful grace, and patience, and love, of the
Lord, that He should bear with such ne'er-do-weels
as we are, even at our very best.  'I am the
Lord, I change not; <i>therefore</i> ye sons of Jacob are
not consumed.'"[<a id="chap07fn30text"></a><a href="#chap07fn30">30</a>]
</p>

<p>
Patient was silent for a while, and Celia broke
the silence.
</p>

<p>
"Patient, what became of Roswith?  I never
hear you name her now, but always as belonging
to past time."
</p>

<p>
Patient did not answer for a moment.  Then
she said, her voice a little less calm than usual:
</p>

<p>
"There is no time, Madam, for her.  She will
never grow old, she will never suffer pain, she will
never weep any more.  The Master has been, and
called for her."
</p>

<p>
"She is dead!" said Celia, sympathizingly.
</p>

<p>
"Dead?  Nay, alive for evermore, as He is.
'Because He liveth, we shall live also.'[<a id="chap07fn31text"></a><a href="#chap07fn31">31</a>]  She is in
the beatific vision, before the face of the Father,
and shall never sin, nor suffer, nor depart any
more.  And we, here in this body of pain and sin,
call them 'dead!'  O Roswith!  O my soul, my
love, my darling! my wee bit bonnie bairn, sister
and daughter in one, whom I loved as David
Jonathan, as mine own soul! surely I am the dead,
and thou art the living!"
</p>

<p>
Celia sat amazed at this sudden flow of
passionate words from her usually imperturbable
companion.  She had seen her moved, only a short
time before, but not like this.  Patient bent her
head low over her work, and did not look up for
some minutes.  When she spoke, it was to say,
very softly:
</p>

<p>
"She never looked up rightly after the harrying
of Lauchie.  She lived, but she never laughed
rightly again.  The Doctor deemed that the ship
wreck&mdash;the shock and the cold and the hunger&mdash;had
wrought the ill.  Maybe they had.  But she
never was a strong, likely lassie.  She was ever
gentle and quiet in all her ways, and could no bear
much putting upon.  And after that she just pined
and wasted away.  It was after Miss Magdalene
died&mdash;after my Lady that is now was wedded&mdash;that
the end came.  It was one Sabbath afternoon,
and I, poor fool! fancied her a wee bit better that
day.  She was lying on the bed in our chamber,
and we had been cracking of divers things&mdash;of our
Lord Christ and His resurrection, and that sweet
prayer of His in John, and the like.  Her voice
was very low and soft&mdash;but it was ever that, I
think&mdash;and her words came slowly and with
pauses.  And when we ended our crack, she saith,
'Patient, Sister! sing to me.'  I asked her, 'What,
dear heart?' and she saith, 'The Twenty-third
Psalm.'  So I sang:
</p>

<p class="poem">
  "'The Lord's my Shepherd, I'll not want.<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He makes me down to lie<br />
  In pastures green: He leadeth me<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The quiet waters by.'<br />
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
"And now and then, just for a line, I heard her
weak voice joining in.  I sang to the end, and she
sang the last lines:
</p>

<p class="poem">
  "'And in God's house for evermore<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My dwelling-place shall be.'<br />
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
"When I had done, I thought the place felt so
still, as if the angels were there.  Surely they
were so! for in a few minutes after I made an end
of singing, she arose and went to the Father.
</p>

<p>
"I have been alone with God since that night
Roswith died.  I shall go some day, but it seems
afar off now.  Perchance it may be nearer than I
deem.  The Lord knoweth the time, and He will
not forget me."
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
There was a long silence when Patient's voice
ceased.  Celia spoke first.
</p>

<p>
"Patient, you said once that you would tell me
how my father met with my step-mother.  But I
want to know also why no one ever sought me out
until now."
</p>

<p>
"There was no chance, Madam, so long as you
were a child.  The troubles in England were too
great to allow of Sir Edward returning himself.  I
believe he charged my Lady on his deathbed
to seek you out, and wherefore she tarried I
know not.  I had a mind once to go myself,
and I named it to her, but was called a fool for my
pains, and bidden to sit quiet and sew.  But I was
glad to see you."
</p>

<p>
"Thank you, dear Patient," said Celia, affectionately.
"And now tell me about the other."
</p>

<p>
"Do you know, Madam, that my Lady was a
widow when she wedded Sir Edward?"
</p>

<p>
"No!" exclaimed Celia.  "I never heard of that.
But Philip&mdash;he is really my brother, is he not?"
</p>

<p>
"Oh yes, Madam!  Mr. Philip is your brother.
I will tell you:&mdash;After my Lady Magdalene died,
Sir Edward was for a time sore sick, and the
doctors bade him visit and go about for the
recovery of his health.  I am scarce certain that
it was the best thing he could do, howbeit he did
as they bade him.  Among the gentlemen whom
he used to visit, where he whiles took his son
Master Edward, and me as his nurse, was the
Marquis of La Croix, and another was one
Mr. Camillus De L'Orient.  The Marquis was
a stately old French gentleman, a kindly man to
his own, I think, but one that held himself
mortal high, and seemed to think that laboring
men and the like were no better, if so good, as his
dogs and his horses.  The Marchioness, his wife,
was much of the same sort, only I'm thinking she
wasn't quite so stiff as he.  They had no son&mdash;and
very grieved they were for it&mdash;only three
daughters: Madam Claudia, Madam Sophia, and Madam
Amata.  The last young lady is dead; she died a
maid, and to my thinking she was a hantle the
best of the three.  Madam Sophia you saw the
other evening; she wedded the Duke of Montausier.
Madam Claudia is my Lady.
</p>

<p>
"I had never any great taking for Frenchmen,
but to my thinking Mr. Camillus De L'Orient was
the best and pleasantest Frenchman I ever saw.
There was something about him so douce and
kindly to everybody; and 'tis very seldom the case
with the French nobles.  Sir Edward came one
day into the nursery, as he often did, to play him
with the bairn; and, said he, 'Patient, next week I
shall go to Monsieur De La Croix's <i>château</i> in the
provinces, and Mademoiselle Aimée has begged
for Edward to come too; so get him and yourself
ready.  Mademoiselle De La Croix is to be
married to Monsieur De L'Orient."  Well, we went
to the castle; and surely there were fine doings:
Madam Claudia in white satin, and all the fine
ladies and gentlemen&mdash;they were quite a picture to
look at.  After the wedding and the revellings were
over, Madam Claudia and her husband went up to
Paris for a while, and then to pay a visit to
Mr. Camillus' father and mother, who lived some
way off.  Sir Edward meanwhile thought of going
home too, but Monsieur and Madam they begged
of him to stay till Mr. Camillus came back,
and Madam Amata, who was mighty fond of
children, and took wonderfully to little Master
Ned, she begged him not to take the bairn away;
so the end of it was that he stopped ever so long,
and Master Ned and me, we stopped too.  About
two months after the wedding, Mr. Camillus
and his new wife came back to the castle, and the
fine doings began again.  There was nought but
feasting and junketing for a fortnight; and one
morning, at the end of that time, Sir Edward, and
Mr. Camillus, and one Mr. Leroy, and three
or four gentlemen more that were staying at
the castle, they went out for a stroll in the park.
</p>

<p>
"I know not rightly how it was, but there arose
some words among these gentlemen, and they
came to quarrelling.  Sir Edward held fast by
Mr. Camillus, who was a great friend of his; but
Mr. Leroy, whose blood was up because of
something that had been said, at last struck
Mr. Camillus a blow.  Everybody cried directly that
he must fight him.  Sir Edward ran back to the
castle for pistols, for the gentlemen were not
armed; and he came in all haste into the chamber
where I was sewing, with little Master at his
horn-book, and bade me tell Madam Claudia as gently
as I could that there was to be a duel between
Mr. Camillus and Mr. Leroy.  I went up into the
chamber where the three young ladies were together,
and Madam Sophia was trying of a new gown.  I
told as quiet as I could what had happened.
Madam Amata cried out, and ran to her sister, and
clipped her round the neck.  She said, 'Claude,
<i>ma soeur, ma bonne, ma belle!</i> go, go to Camille,
and ask him not to fight!'  I looked at Madam
Claudia.  She went as white as a sheet the first
minute; but the next she lifted her head up
proudly, and she said, 'Shall I ask him not
to revenge an affront to his honor?  <i>Noblesse
oblige, ma soeur</i>.'  'You are such a child, Aimée!'
was all Madam Sophia said, as she looked round
from her tiring-glass.  'You always call me so,'
said Madam Amata; 'but this is dreadful&mdash;it
is death, perhaps, my sisters!'  Madam Sophia
took no heed of her, but went on trying her
new gown, and showing her woman where it did
not please her.  For a minute I thought that
Madam Claudia was going to give way and have a
good cry; but she did not.  I scarce knew then
that 'tis not our deepest sorrow that we weep for.
She sat down, still very white, and taking no heed
to her sister's new array, though she, poor thoughtless
maid!  kept calling to her, didn't she like this
and did she no think that was too long and t'other
too narrow?  Madam Amata came softly up
to me, and whispered '<i>Ma bonne</i>, go down and
bring us the first news.'  So I slipped out and
down-stairs.  About half an hour after a
gentleman came in&mdash;a French gentleman, but I forget
his name now&mdash;who I knew had been at the fighting.
I called to him and asked him to pardon me
for being so bold as to speak to him, but for the
love of God to tell me the news.  'News?' quoth
he, 'what! of the duel?  Oh! they have fought,
and Monsieur De L'Orient has fallen: Sir Edward
Ingram is carrying him here'&mdash;and Mr. Somebody,
I don't mind who it was.  'Is he dead, Sir?' I
said, all of a tremble.  'I really don't know,' says
he, quite careless; 'I think not quite.'
</p>

<p>
"I hadn't the heart to speak another word to
such a man.  I crept up again to the young ladies'
chamber, and I knelt down by Madam Claudia,
and told her she must make ready for the worst.
She shivered all over, and then, scarce opening her
white lips, she said, 'Is it all over?'  I said,
'They think not quite; but Sir Edward is
bringing him hither.'  When she heard that, she rose
and glided down the stairs to the hall, Madam
Amata following her, and I likewise.  Even Madam
Sophia was a trifle touched, I think, for she said a
bad word, as those French ladies do when they are
astonished; but Madam Amata was very white
and crying, for if Mr. Camillus had really been her
brother born, I don't think she could have loved
him much better than she did.
</p>

<p>
"Just as Madam Claudia reached the hall, Sir
Edward came in, and the other gentleman, bearing
poor Mr. Camillus covered with blood.  There was
a marble couch in the hall, with silken cushions;
they laid him down there, and he just spoke twice.
First he said to Sir Edward, 'Tell my mother
gently, and take care of my Claude.'  And then
when Madam Claudia came and knelt by him, he
said, '<i>Dieu vous garde, mamie</i>!'  Then he laid his
head back and died.  But when he died, Madam
Claudia threw her arms about him, and laid her
head down on his breast in spite of the blood:
and then suddenly springing to her feet, she flung
up her arms wildly in a way that sent a shudder
through me, and the next minute she would have
fallen on the ground if Sir Edward had not caught
her first.  'Let us carry her up, Patient, to her own
chamber, poor soul!' he saith.  So we took her up,
I and he, and I laid her quiet on her bed.  Madam
Amata followed us, and, poor young maid! it was
pitiful to see her.  She had never been taught to
do more than make fancy-work and play the violin
and such, and now she wanted to nurse her sister,
and did not know how to set about it.  'Do tell
me, <i>ma bonne</i>, what I can do for Claude?&mdash;my poor
Claude!' she kept saying to me.  'Twas a long
while ere Madam Claudia came round, and when
she did, she wept and mourned every minute of the
day for four days.  I don't think she ever quite
loved anything again as she had loved him."
</p>

<p>
Celia could hardly associate the idea of such
mourning as this with her cold, fashionable,
impassive step-mother.
</p>

<p>
"You think it scarce like, Madam?" asked
Patience, seeing her thought in her face.  "I know
what you think&mdash;ay, and more than you have
thought that.  If you will forgive me to say it, you
deem her cold and hard.  So she is.  Ah Madam! wherever
sorrow softens and sanctifies not, it chills
and hardens.  I am sure, if I had known her but
now, I could never have thought her that bright
lassie whom I saw in her early maidenhood.  You
see, Madam, the Lord sends sorrow to us all; but
where He has to touch one of His chosen with it,
He brings it Himself.  And there is a vast
difference between the two.  There be to whom the
having been with grief is the having been with
Jesus; and that always softens and tenders the
heart.  I think we hardly come to know the Lord's
best comforts, till we come to know how sorely He
can afflict whiles.  But grief without Jesus&mdash;ah! that
is worth calling grief!
</p>

<p>
"There is little more to tell now, Madam, for
you know the end&mdash;that Sir Edward wedded
Madam Claudia.  I will confess I did think they
might have waited a trifle longer, if it were only to
the end of the year after Mr. Camillus' death.  He
had scarce been dead six months, and my Lady
Magdalene not the year out, when they were
married.  Howbeit, that was their business, not
mine.  Madam Sophia said, in her odd way, that
if her sister did not care, she saw no reason why
she should: but the tears stood in Madam Amata's
eyes, though she said nought.  I liked Madam
Amata very much.  She died about two years
thereafter."
</p>

<p>
"Patient, whom do you think Philip like?&mdash;his
father or his mother?"
</p>

<p>
"Neither much, Madam.  Sir Edward is like his
father, only that he hath his mother's mouth.
</p>

<p>
"Do you know when he will be back, Patient?
I do so long to see my <i>own</i> brother."
</p>

<p>
"No, Madam.  He went off rather unexpected.
Now, Madam Celia, if you please to try this gown?"
</p>

<p>
"Why, Patient! what have you done to that
blue gauze?" inquired Lady Ingram, entering so
noiselessly that neither knew of her presence until
she spoke.  "It is cut absurdly short in front.
Turn round, my dear.  <i>Mais c'est affreux</i>!  Pull
the rag off, I beg of you.  Is that Thérèse's
cutting or yours, Patient?"
</p>

<p>
"Thérèse's, Madam."
</p>

<p>
"<i>Incroyable</i>!  I shall scold her right well for
it.  It is atrocious.  <i>C'est une chose à déchirer de
coeur!</i>"
</p>

<p>
Celia looked up into Lady Ingram's eyes, saw
how calm and careless they were, and wondered if
there were left in her anything of that early Claude
De La Croix, whose sad story she had been hearing.

<p>
We have been absent for a long time from
Ashcliffe Hall.  In fact, nothing has occurred
there since Celia's departure of sufficient moment
to be recorded.  But on Easter Tuesday of 1712,
Harry returned home for a short time.  He
brought plenty of town news, political and otherwise.
</p>

<p>
"Twelve new Tory peers were created on New
Year's Day"&mdash;
</p>

<p>
The Squire swore at this piece of information.
</p>

<p>
"And the Duke of Marlborough[<a id="chap08fn1text"></a><a href="#chap08fn1">1</a>] has fallen in
disgrace"&mdash;
</p>

<p>
"So we heard, lad, so we heard," said his father,
discontentedly.  "Somebody ought to be ashamed
of himself."
</p>

<p>
"And Prince Eugene[<a id="chap08fn2text"></a><a href="#chap08fn2">2</a>] is come to England on a
visit to Her Majesty, 'tis thought to plead for the
Duke."
</p>

<p>
"O Harry! have you seen Prince Eugene?"
</p>

<p>
"Yes, Lucy, several times.  Do you wish to
know what he is like?  Well, fancy a small, but
well-made man, with a dark complexion, a large
Roman nose, black eyes, lively and piercing, and
black hair."
</p>

<p>
"Do you think the Queen will listen to his
pleading for the Duke?"
</p>

<p>
"I doubt it.  'Tis scarce so much with the Duke
as with the Duchess[<a id="chap08fn3text"></a><a href="#chap08fn3">3</a>] that she is herself displeased;
and Prince Eugene has already offended her by
coming to court in a bag-wig instead of the
peruque.  She said to her ladies that next time she
supposed he would come in his night-cap.  Prince
Eugene, you see, is a soldier, accustomed to think
very little of matters of this kind; and in all points
of etiquette the Queen is mighty particular."
</p>

<p>
"And what other news is there, Harry?"
</p>

<p>
"Well, Sir, the Secretary for War, a young man
named Robert Walpole, has been sent to the
Tower for bribery."
</p>

<p>
"Why on earth have they sent him there for
<i>that</i>?" asked the Squire, sarcastically.  "Does not
every one of the Ministers sell all his Secretary-ships?
Didn't he buy his place, to begin with?"
</p>

<p>
"Doubtless, Sir," answered Harry; "and every
year the Duchess of Marlborough, whose perquisite
they are, either gives or sells the Queen's old
gowns; but when the blame must be laid on some
one, 'tis easy to find a man to bear it."
</p>

<p>
"Any other piece of roguery?" asked his father.
</p>

<p>
"No, Sir, I remember none," said Harry.  "Just
before I left London, the Queen was touching for
the evil.[<a id="chap08fn4text"></a><a href="#chap08fn4">4</a>]  'Tis a solemn ceremony, I am told,
though I was not able to see it.  'Tis stale news, I
fear, that there hate been prosecutions of
newspaper writers for attacks on the Ministry.
</p>

<p>
"No, Harry, I had not heard of that," said the
Squire, quickly.  "Likely enough!  A set of
beggarly printers daring to bring out lampoons on
gentlemen in the Queen's service!  Served 'em
right!"
</p>

<p>
"There have been a good many of the lampoons,
I believe."
</p>

<p>
"Is it only the Whig Ministers who suffered
from these rascally newspapers?" asked his father.
</p>

<p>
"Both sides, Sir," answered Harry.
</p>

<p>
"Well, I am glad the Tories got a bit of it."
chuckled Squire Passmore.
</p>

<p>
"There are gentlemen on the other side, Sir, I
think," hinted Harry quietly.
</p>

<p>
"Nothing but rogues on the other side, my lad,"
said his father.  "Why, how could they be on the
other side if they weren't rogues?"
</p>

<p>
"Why, Father!" said Lucy, who could take
more liberties with that gentleman than any one
else, and knew it; "you don't think everybody
wrong who isn't on the same side as you?"
</p>

<p>
"There can be only one right side," said the
Squire, as evasively as oracularly.  "I am on it
because 'tis right."
</p>

<p>
"Well, my politics," said Charley, yawning, "are
that 'tis right because I'm on it."
</p>

<p>
A piece of exalted egotism which provoked
universal laughter.
</p>

<p>
"I met in London with a rather pleasant fellow,"
remarked Harry, "who told me he had been
at Ashcliffe, and had the honor, quoth he, of
dining with you.  A man of the name of Stevens."
</p>

<p>
"Ob, aye! a painter," said the Squire.
</p>

<p>
"Well, he had been in a painter's employ,"
returned his son, "but is now in a newspaper office:
he is employed on the <i>Gazette</i>."
</p>

<p>
"What made him change his trade in that way?"
</p>

<p>
"He told me that the painter who had employed
him had been but a temporary patron, and having
now done with him, he had been unable to get
further employment in that line.  And having some
parts in the way of writing, he had offered his
services to one or two of the Whig papers, and is
now in the <i>Gazette's</i> office."
</p>

<p>
"He is a sensible fellow," said his father.  "A
right Whig, I could see, and a thorough
conscientious man."
</p>

<p>
Could any person have lifted up the veil, and
revealed to him the history and identity of one
George Shepherd, he would have felt both amazed
and humbled.
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
At the moment that this conversation was going
on at Ashcliffe, the thoroughly conscientious man of
whom they were speaking was seated in the back-parlor
of a newspaper office in London.  He had
two companions, a man in a fair wig, and another
in a black one.  The wearer of the black wig, a
large-limbed, long-faced, solemn-looking man, had
just folded up some letters after perusal.
</p>

<p>
"Well, Mr. Mist, what say you?" asked he, laying
down the letters.  "If you prefer to sever our
connection, rather than engage to do as I wish, of
course you are at liberty to do so.  But unless you
will keep measures with me, and be punctual in
these things, I cannot serve you further, nor be
concerned any more."
</p>

<p>
"I really beg you not to name such a thing,
Mr. De Foe!" replied Mist, bowing and nervously
twisting a piece of paper.  "I am your very
humble servant in these matters&mdash;all of them; and I
engage readily to conduct the <i>Journal</i>&mdash;Will you
repeat your terms, Mr. De Foe?"
</p>

<p>
"The Government, Mr. Mist, have treated you
with lenity and forbearance," resumed De Foe,[<a id="chap08fn5text"></a><a href="#chap08fn5">5</a>]
oracularly.  "They permit you to seem on the
same side as before, to rally the <i>Flying Post</i> as
much as you please, and all the Whig writers, and
even the word 'Whig;' and to admit any foolish
trifling things in favor of the Tories, such as really
can do them no good, nor the Government any harm."
</p>

<p>
"Well, Mr. De Foe," said Mr. Mist, with a sigh,
"that is liberty enough.  I am resolved that my
paper shall for the future amuse the Tories, but
not affront the Government."
</p>

<p>
"That, Mr. Mist," announced his dictator, "is
the only way to keep yourself from a jail, and to
secure the advantages which now rise to you from
it; for you may be assured the complaint against
you is so general that the Government can bear it
no longer."[<a id="chap08fn6text"></a><a href="#chap08fn6">6</a>]
</p>

<p>
"Would you mind telling me from whom you
speak, Sir?" Mr. Mist meekly wished to know.
</p>

<p>
"I should mind it very much, Mr. Mist.  Be
satisfied that you have been spoken to&mdash;ay, and
warned."
</p>

<p>
Mr. Mist was fully convinced of that.
</p>

<p>
"You will write, Mr. Mist, a declaration, full
enough to satisfy the Government, of your
intention to make no further attack upon them?"
</p>

<p>
Mr. Mist would do anything he was told.  The
poor little mouse was entirely at the mercy of the
lion.  He withdrew to pen his declaration, and left
the arch-conspirators together.
</p>

<p>
"You see, Mr. Stevens, what difficulties we
Government spies have to contend with!" sighed
the author of <i>Robinson Crusoe</i>.  "But you know
that, of course, as well as I do."
</p>

<p>
"'Bowing in the House of Rimmon,'" responded
Stevens, with a peculiar smile.  "I fancy the spies
on the other side have their difficulties also."
</p>

<p>
In which observation, though De Foe was completely
unaware of it, Mr. Stevens was alluding to
himself.
</p>

<p>
"'Bowing in the House of Rimmon!'" repeated
De Foe.  "I thank you, Mr. Stevens, for so apt a
comparison.  You see, Sir, I am for this service
posted among Papists, Jacobites, and High Tories&mdash;a
generation which my very soul abhors.  I am
obliged to hear traitorous expressions and
outrageous words against Her Majesty's person and
Government and her most faithful servants, and to
smile at it all as if I approved of it."
</p>

<p>
"You are scarce the first person, Mr. De Foe,
who has been constrained to smile at what he
disapproves."
</p>

<p>
"Well, his Lordship's instructions are positive."
</p>

<p>
"You have them, I think, from himself?" asked
Stevens, deferentially.
</p>

<p>
"Through Mr. Buckley.  I introduced myself to
Mr. Mist in the disguise of a translator of foreign
news, with his Lordship's approbation, who
commissioned me, in this manner, to be so far
concerned in this weekly paper of Mist's, as to be
able to keep it within the circle of a secret
management, and also prevent the mischievous part of
it; but neither Mist nor any of those concerned
with him have the least guess by whose direction
I do it.  You, Mr. Stevens, are one of ourselves, so
I speak freely to you."
</p>

<p>
"Quite so," answered Stevens, dryly.
</p>

<p>
"Some time ago," resumed De Foe, "I was concerned
in the same manner with Dyer's News-Letter.
Old Dyer was just dead, and Dormer, his
successor, being unable by his troubles to carry on
that work, I had an offer of a share both in the
property and management.  Well, I immediately
sent to the Minister, who, by Mr. Buckley, let me
know 'twould be a very acceptable piece of
service, for that letter was really very prejudicial to
the public, and the most difficult to come at in a
judicial way in case of offence given.  Upon this
I took upon myself (and do still take) the entire
management of the paper, so that the style still
continues Tory, that the party may be amused,
and not set up another, which would destroy the
design."[<a id="chap08fn7text"></a><a href="#chap08fn7">7</a>]
</p>

<p>
"Of course your object was not wholly political?"
smilingly suggested Stevens.
</p>

<p>
"You mean, there was a matter of money betwixt
us?  Of course there was&mdash;money or money's
worth."
</p>

<p>
"We have it on good authority that 'the laborer
is worthy of his hire,'" answered Stevens, still
smiling.  "Ah!  Mr. De Foe, 'tis in truth such as
you and I that rule kingdoms&mdash;not Kings nor
Ministers."
</p>

<p>
When Stevens left the office of Mist's <i>Journal</i>,
which was in truth Mist's private habitation, he
sauntered slowly for a while along the busy streets;
turned into a (Whig) coffee-house, which he
frequented every Tuesday morning, and called for a
dish of coffee and the <i>Postboy</i>; wandering on,
turned into another (Tory) coffee-house, which he
frequented every Tuesday afternoon, and called for
a glass of usquebagh and the <i>St. James's Chronicle</i>.
Having made his weekly impression on the society
of the two coffee-houses, he sauntered on again
until he reached Gray's Inn Road.  Here his
proceedings suddenly changed.  He walked up
the Road with the air and pace of a man who had
no time to spare, and entering a whitesmith's shop,
inquired in a rather loud tone whether Butler (the
whitesmith) could attend to a little matter of
business.  Mrs. Butler, who was in the shop, having
informed him that her husband was at leisure to
undertake anything required, Stevens sinking his
voice to a low whisper, asked further&mdash;
</p>

<p>
"Is the old horse in the old stall?"
</p>

<p>
"He is, Sir," answered Mrs. Butler, in the same
tone, adding, in a louder one, "Pray go up-stairs,
Sir, and speak with Butler yourself."
</p>

<p>
Stevens found his way without difficulty up a
dark and rickety staircase in the corner, with the
intricacies of which he appeared well acquainted,
and pausing at a door on the right hand, at the
head of the stairs, placed his lips to the keyhole,
and gave a low, soft whistle.  The door opened
with a spring, and Mr. Stevens was admitted to
the chamber within.
</p>

<p>
In the room in question, two men were sitting at
a green baize table covered with books and papers.
The younger was about the age of Stevens himself,
and he looked up with a nod and smile of recognition
to the new-comer: the elder, a bald-headed
man with a fringe of white hair, did not stir from
his close examination of the papers on the table
until Stevens stood before him.
</p>

<p>
"Your blessing, Father!" requested the young priest.
</p>

<p>
The old man looked up abruptly.  "Peace be
with thee, Brother Cuthbert," said he, in a harsh,
brusque tone; and he went back immediately to
his papers.  The younger man pointed to a seat at
his side, which Stevens took; but neither ventured
to interrupt the studies of the old priest, until he
at last laid down his papers and took off his
spectacles.
</p>

<p>
"Well, Brother, what news?" said he, looking
up at Stevens.
</p>

<p>
In answer to this query, Stevens gave him a
condensed account of the information which he
had just received from De Foe.
</p>

<p>
"That is awkward, Father, is it not?" asked the
younger of the strangers.
</p>

<p>
"Not at all, my son," said the old Jesuit, placidly
wiping his spectacles.  "The Protestants are
welcome to work against us as much as they
please.  They cannot combine; they have no
organism; hence their wiles are mere shadows
compared with ours.  They are sure to fade and
fail, sooner or later.  However, we are not above
learning even from enemies.  It might be as
well to have a friend so employed on some few
Whig papers.  Could you manage that?" he
asked, suddenly turning to the young stranger.
</p>

<p>
The person addressed smiled, but shook his
head rather hopelessly.
</p>

<p>
"I do not think I could, Father Boniface," said he.
</p>

<p>
"No," assented the old man; "your talents do
not lie in that direction.  Brother Cuthbert, here
is employment for you&mdash;yours do."
</p>

<p>
"My talents commonly lie in any direction to
which I find it convenient to turn them, Father,"
said Stevens, with as modest an air as if he were
disclaiming praise instead of bestowing it upon
himself.  "And as I hold a general dispensation
for anything that may be needful, I have no
scruples in using it."
</p>

<p>
The old man, having finished a very careful
cleansing of his glasses, put them on, and inspected
Stevens through them.
</p>

<p>
"Brother Cuthbert," said he, "had you been
suffered to sink into the abyss of heresy, as at one
time seemed likely, it would have been a great
loss to the Church."
</p>

<p>
"Well, I rather think it would," was the cool
reply of Mr. Cuthbert Stevens.
</p>

<p>
"It was a blessed act of our Brother Arnold,"
resumed Father Boniface, "an inspired thought,
which led him to steal you away, an infant
untainted by heresy, from the cradle wherein your
heretic mother had laid you, while she went to
watch the dancing on the village-green.  That
was Brother Cuthbert's introduction to the
Church, Jerome," observed he, turning to his
companion.  "Our Brother Arnold&mdash;he is among
the blessed now, I trust, for I have myself offered
hundreds of masses for the repose of his soul&mdash;he
found, in a village in France, an infant in a cradle,
by a cottage-door, with none to watch over it.
Impelled by philanthropy, he inquired how this
was from the next-door neighbor, and was told
that a Huguenot carpenter lived in the cottage;
he was out at work, and his wife had gone to see
the dancers.  'This must not be,' said Arnold; 'I
will myself carry the infant to his mother, and
reprove her for such foolish conduct.'  I should have
told you that, the village being full of these
misguided heretics, Arnold, in his zeal to recover
some of these straying sheep to the true fold, had
attired himself as a heretic teacher.  'You will do
well, Master Pastor,' said the neighbor; 'for
though she is kindly and well-meaning, 'tis her
worst fault to love gadding about, and she is very
young and needs teaching.'  So Arnold took the
babe, and instead of going to the green, piously
brought it to us at the monastery.  Thou wert a
sad trouble for a long time, Brother Cuthbert; for
the brethren were not wont to deal with such
tender young creatures, and thou wouldst eat
nothing presented to thee, and didst wail and
howl ceaselessly."
</p>

<p>
And the old priest shook his head sorrowfully,
as if he remembered too well the trouble which
the Huguenot baby had brought upon the
brotherhood.  Stevens laughed, and so did Jerome;
but the latter seemed to enjoy the novel idea more
of the two.
</p>

<p>
"Do you know the name of the village, Father?
It might be a good act to endeavor to win over
some of these Huguenots."
</p>

<p>
"We thought it better, Brother Cuthbert, that
you should not know the name of your birthplace.
Ties of kindred are strong at times; and, as I
have often observed to you, when a man becomes
a priest, he ceases to have any kindred ties.  The
Church is your mother, her monks are your brethren,
her nuns your sisters.  Be satisfied."
</p>

<p>
Stevens was far too much accustomed to instant
and implicit submission to offer the slightest
remonstrance to this slight mandate.  But this was
the first time that he had ever received a detailed
account of his origin.  He knew that he had been
brought to the monastery as an infant, but
hitherto he had known nothing more, and had naturally
supposed himself to be a foundling.  In this idea
he had grown up.  He had never loved any human
being, nor, so far as he knew, had any human
being ever loved him.  But that afternoon a vision
rose before him of the poor Huguenot mother
coming back from her thoughtless expedition to
find her darling gone.  He wished he could have
found her.  He would have tried to convert her to
Romanism if he had done so; for he honestly
believed his Church the true one.  But she might
perhaps have loved him; and nobody ever had
done so hitherto.
</p>

<p>
"In these papers, Brother Cuthbert," resumed
the old Jesuit, "you will find instructions in cipher.
I need not charge you to keep them carefully."
</p>

<p>
Stevens put them safely away in a private pocket.
</p>

<p>
"And I will detain you no longer."
</p>

<p>
Stevens had reached the door, when he turned
back.
</p>

<p>
"Father Boniface, if you think it not an improper
request, would you tell me in what part of
France I was found?"
</p>

<p>
Father Boniface looked into his young friend's
face, and thought it a very improper request.  But
he had his own reasons for not bluntly refusing an
answer.
</p>

<p>
"In Auvergne, my son," he said, shortly.  "Ask
no more."
</p>

<p>
Cuthbert Stevens passed out of the whitesmith's
shop without stopping for his customary five
minutes' chat with Mrs. Butler.
</p>

<p>
"Ah, poor gentleman!" said she to herself;
"he's had a bit of bad news."
</p>

<p>
He had had something like it.  He walked very
rapidly up Gray's Inn Road, knowing little and
caring less whither he was going, till he found
himself in the fields beyond Clerkenwell.  There
he threw himself on the grass, and resting his
head upon his hands, gave himself up for one
hour to mournful and profitless visions of that
Auvergne home, and of the unknown father and
mother who might have loved him once.
</p>

<p>
"And I shall never see them!" he thought.
"So near the Waldensian valleys:&mdash;what a stronghold
of heresy they must be!  Ah, well!  I can say
every day a mass with an intention for my parents.
Who knows if God may be merciful to them, after
all?  The soul is worth more than the body, and
eternal happiness is worth more than any amount
of ease or felicity in this world.  From what a
fate, therefore, have I been rescued!  I ought to
be very thankful."
</p>

<p>
But gratitude and love are the last things into
which a man can scold himself, and Stevens did
not feel so thankful as he thought he ought to be.
He might have been more so, had he known that
Father Boniface had not troubled himself to tell
him the exact truth.  It was from the outermost
village of the Val Martino, in the Waldensian
valleys, not from Auvergne, that he had been stolen
away.  And in that Val Martino, though he was
never to know it, every night knelt Lucetta
Carmagnoli, mourning before God&mdash;less for the
martyred husband, or for the two brave young sons
slain in battle, than for the lost first-born, whose
fate she could guess only too well.  Wavering from
hour to hour between the passion of hope&mdash;"Oh
that Ishmael might live before Thee!"[<a id="chap08fn8text"></a><a href="#chap08fn8">8</a>]&mdash;and the
passion of despair&mdash;"Would God I had died for
thee!  O Absalom, my son, my son!"[<a id="chap08fn9text"></a><a href="#chap08fn9">9</a>]
</p>

<p>
Such prayers and tears seem lost sometimes.
But "are they not in Thy book?"[<a id="chap08fn10text"></a><a href="#chap08fn10">10</a>]  "What I do
thou knowest not now; but thou shalt know
hereafter."[<a id="chap08fn11text"></a><a href="#chap08fn11">11</a>]  It is not only Simon the son of Jonas
who is asked, now in the tempest, now in the still,
small voice, "Lovest thou Me more than these?"[<a id="chap08fn12text"></a><a href="#chap08fn12">12</a>]
</p>

<p>
Stevens rose from his green couch, and walked
back to London.  His heart had been dormant all
his life till now, and it went easily to sleep again.
His conscience the Jesuits had crushed and twisted
and trained so early that it never troubled him
with a single pang.  By the time that he had
reached Fleet Street, and had solaced his inner
man with a second dish of coffee (and something
in it) at the Tory coffee-house, Mr. Cuthbert
Stevens was himself again.  And if he did look
back on the hour spent in the fields at Clerkenwell,
it was only to reflect with momentary annoyance
that, as he would have phrased it, he had made a
fool of himself.  And it was very rarely indeed
that he thought that substantive applicable in the
slightest degree to the Rev. Cuthbert Stevens.
</p>

<p>
"Well, there is one comfort," he meditated, as
he sat imbibing the mixture: "nobody saw me do it."
</p>

<p>
And fortified by this consideration, and the
coffee, &amp;c., Mr. Stevens walked into the residence
of the Editor of the <i>Postboy</i>, and expressed his
desire for an interview with that rather awful
individual.  There was a smile on his lips when he
came out.  He was engaged at a high salary to
supply foreign news to the columns of the Whig
paper.  Mr. Buckley, the Ministerial agent, had
spoken very highly of Mr. Stevens to the Editor.
Mr. Stevens was rejoiced to hear it, and he told the
truth for once when he said so.  The Editor
thought Mr. Stevens set a rather high value on his
services.  Mr. Stevens could assure him that he
had received innumerable applications from the
Tory side, and it was only his deep attachment to
the Whig cause, and his respect for the <i>Postboy</i> in
particular, which had led him, by asking so little,
rather to underrate the importance of the information
he could supply.  The importance, indeed, of
the information which Stevens could have supplied
would not have been overrated at double the
figure; but of this little fact the Editor of the
<i>Postboy</i> was unconscious.
</p>

<p>
Here we part with the Rev. Cuthbert Stevens.
The rest of his life was a mere repetition, with
variations, of what we have seen.  The Whigs
continued to take him for a Whig spy, the Tories
for a Tory, while he himself cared in reality for
neither, and was devoted but to one thing, and
ready to be either, neither, or both, in the service
and at the command of that Church which supplied
to him the place of home, and parents, and friends,
and God.  And at the close of such a life followed
the priest, and the crucifix, and the unction, and
the false hope which shall perish, and the death
that has no bands.
</p>

<p>
Ere this Rome has employed, and destroyed,
many a Cuthbert Stevens.  What do the crushed
devotees matter to the idol?  Let the car of
Juggernaut roll on!  "Thou art become guilty in
thy blood that thou hast shed, and hast defiled
thyself in thine idols which thou hast made."[<a id="chap08fn13text"></a><a href="#chap08fn13">13</a>]  "In
the cup which she hath filled, fill to her
double."[<a id="chap08fn14text"></a><a href="#chap08fn14">14</a>]
</p>

<p>
Perhaps the greatest of Lucetta Carmagnoli's
mercies was what she thought the bitterest of her
sorrows&mdash;that she never knew what became of her
lost child.

<p>
It is time for us to return to France.
</p>

<p>
On one of these spring afternoons of 1712, Celia
stood looking out of her bedroom window.  They
were in Lady Ingram's country-house at
St. Germain-en-Laye.  She was very curious, and yet
almost afraid, to see the Palace&mdash;that house in
which, as she knew, he dwelt whom Squire Passmore
called the Pretender, and Lady Ingram the
King.  Celia herself had owned to no politics at
all.  She found it quite work enough to steer
between her religious Scyllas and Charybdises,
without setting up political ones.  In all things
not absolutely wrong, she was resolved meekly to
submit to Lady Ingram, so that her step-mother
might have no just cause for dissatisfaction with
her in respect to those few points which to her
were really matters of conscience.  When Patient
came quietly in with an armful of the linen which
she was unpacking and putting away, Celia said&mdash;
</p>

<p>
"Patient, do you know where the <i>château</i> is?"
</p>

<p>
"The Pretender dwells over yonder, Madam,"
answered Patient, pointing in the direction which
she wished to indicate.
</p>

<p>
"So you call him the Pretender!" observed
Celia, smilingly.
</p>

<p>
"I was taught, Madam, when a wean, that the
people should have nought to do with an uncovenanted
King.  Moreover, the reign of His Highness
the Lord Protector being so much better for
the faith, hath perhaps turned me a little against
this one and all his."
</p>

<p>
Celia laughed softly to herself.  What would
Squire Passmore have said, from whose lips the
gentleman so respectfully designated by Patient
was, at the gentlest, "that scoundrel Oliver"?
She began to wonder how many more phases of
political feeling she should find.
</p>

<p>
"I ask your pardon if I have grieved you,
Madam," said Patient, when Celia remained
silent, "I would not willingly do that.  Sir
Edward, I know, was strong for King James, and
would doubtless have been so for his son: and 'tis
most like you will feel with your father.  Only we
were taught otherwise.  When King James was
driven out of London, I heard that, the Sabbath
after, in Scotland, a certain godly minister did
discourse from that word&mdash;'And death shall be
chosen rather than life by all the residue of them
that remain of this evil family, which remain in all
the places whither I have driven them, saith the
Lord of hosts.'"[<a id="chap08fn15text"></a><a href="#chap08fn15">15</a>]
</p>

<p>
"I think that was rather too strong, Patient,"
said Celia, doubtfully.
</p>

<p>
"Perchance so, Madam.  Indeed, I know there
be some that do think King Charles the First
safe&mdash;in Heaven, I mean.  God grant it!  I only
know that he was a deceitful man, and an
uncovenanted King."
</p>

<p>
"I have always heard him called a martyr, Patient."
</p>

<p>
"He was not <i>that</i>!" said Patient, less calmly
than usual.  "At least, not if a martyr be a witness
for the Lord's truth.  Did he not try to force
Prelacy upon Scotland?  Call such a man a martyr!
A martyr to Prelacy, forsooth! a martyr to
deceit, and broken faith, and cruel oppression!
We were the martyrs, Madam."  And Patient shut
a drawer wrathfully, for her.
</p>

<p>
"I don't know much about it, Patient," said
Celia, honestly.  "I have been taught to believe
that King Charles was a good and misfortunate
man.  But now I can hardly tell what to believe
among you all.  My&mdash;Squire Passmore thinks that
King Charles was a good man and a martyr, yet
calls this man the Pretender, and will scarce hear
him named with patience.  My step-mother thinks
them both good; and you think them both bad.
I cannot tell what to think."
</p>

<p>
Celia came from the window as Lady Ingram
entered the room.
</p>

<p>
"Patient," she said, "lay out Mrs. Celia's new
court-dress on the bed&mdash;you know which it is.
My dear, this afternoon I will lead you to kiss the
Queen's hand.  Your manners are slightly
improved, and I wish you to show respect to the
Court."
</p>

<p>
"Very well, Madam," resignedly answered Celia.
</p>

<p>
"You will enter behind me; stop, and go
forward, when I do.  When I draw aside, come
forward, kneel, and kiss the Queen's hand when she
offers it.  Should she speak to you, remain
kneeling while you answer, unless she command you to
rise.  If she do not speak, rise, draw to one side,
as I shall have done, and stand there."
</p>

<p>
"Yes, Madam."
</p>

<p>
"Do not look about you: keep your eyes on the
Queen.  Don't look awkward.  Be self-possessed."
</p>

<p>
"I will do my best, Madam."
</p>

<p>
Lady Ingram tapped Celia's cheek with her fan,
a sign, that she was unusually gracious.  "Be
ready in an hour," she said, and departed.
</p>

<p>
Thérèse came next to dress Celia's hair.  Patient,
in solemn and evidently disapproving silence,
helped her to dress.  She found herself, when the
process was over, in a quilted pink satin petticoat,
a bodice and train of white satin, trimmed with
gold braid, white satin shoes, long white gloves,
pearl necklace and bracelets: her hair was dressed
very high, and adorned with pink roses and pearls.
As Celia looked at herself in the glass, she felt much
inclined to sing with the celebrated little old woman,
"Sure this is none of I!" but much time was not
allowed her for the indulgence of that feeling.
</p>

<p>
"Your servant, Madam!" observed Philip's
voice in the corridor, accompanied by a tap at the
door.  "Don't keep us waiting, please,&mdash;we shall
be very cross if you do.  I protest! aren't you
smart!"
</p>

<p>
Mr. Philip himself was scarcely less so.  He
wore a light blue coat embroidered in gold, a white
satin waistcoat and breeches, white silk stockings,
and white satin shoes with large rosettes.  In the
drawing-room stood Lady Ingram, attired in white
and gold.
</p>

<p>
"Turn round!" was her greeting to Celia and
Philip.  "Nonsense, not you!" as Philip made a
<i>pirouette</i> in answer.  "That will do.  Now, follow
me; and whatever you feel, don't look awkward or
afraid."
</p>

<p>
Celia meekly followed her step-mother to the
carriage, which rolled away with the trio, and in a
few minutes deposited them at one of the
half-dozen doors of a large and stately mansion.  On
the terrace, before them, ladies and gentlemen
were walking and chatting, most of them in rather
shabby, though full, court-dress.  Lady Ingram
bowed to two or three, gave her hand to her son,
and once more enjoining Celia to keep close
behind, passed on into the Palace.
</p>

<p>
"This is English ground, Madam," observed
Philip, over his shoulder.
</p>

<p>
Celia wished it were.  Up lofty staircases,
through suites of rooms, past groups of servants in
the royal livery of England, worn and faded, she
followed Lady Ingram and Philip, until in one
apartment a lady dressed in black rose to meet
them, and shook hands with Lady Ingram.
</p>

<p>
"You can go in to the Queen, my friend," she
said; "there is only His Majesty with her."
</p>

<p>
There were only two persons in the room beyond.
A gentleman stood at the window reading
the <i>Gazette</i>; a lady in mourning sat writing at a very
shabby little table in the middle of the room.  A
glance at each assured Celia that they were mother
and son; and she speedily discovered who they
were, by Lady Ingram's kneeling before the
quiet-looking lady in mourning, who sat at the shabby
little table.
</p>

<p>
"Ah, <i>ma chère</i>!" said the lady, in a soft voice,
turning to her; adding, "I am very glad to see
you.  It is long since I had the pleasure."
</p>

<p>
Lady Ingram answered in French, and still
kneeling, "I have been in Paris, Madame, and in
England for a short time.  I had the honor to
inform your Majesty that I was going there to fetch
my step-daughter."
</p>

<p>
"This is your daughter?" asked the Queen, turning
with a smile to Celia.
</p>

<p>
Lady Ingram drew aside to leave room for her.
"She scarcely speaks French yet," she observed.
</p>

<p>
As Celia knelt and looked up into the face before
her, she was much struck with that smile.  It
changed the aspect of the whole face.  The air of
subdued sadness which had dwelt upon the classic
regular features and in the quiet soft eyes, passed
away, and a brighter expression lighted them
brilliantly while the smile remained.  She could fancy
what that face might have been in the old days,
when, at the close of the coronation, nearly thirty
years before, the Westminster students had called
up that smile by their spontaneous shout of "<i>Vivat
Regina Maria!</i>"  Celia forgot all about kissing the
Queen's hand, until she heard Lady Ingram's
voice beside her whisper, in a subdued tone, "<i>Cette
folle!</i>"  Then she blushed painfully and hastily
performed her homage.  The charm which
enfolded the Jacobites had been cast around her;
the spell of voice, and eyes, and smile, which she
would never forget any more.
</p>

<p>
"Why so hurried, my child?" asked the soft
voice, in Celia's own tongue.  "Do not be
frightened of me, I pray you."
</p>

<p>
Frightened of <i>her</i>?  No, indeed! thought Celia,
as she rose from her knees with a smile in answer
to the Queen's.  What fright she felt was not for
Her Majesty, but for Lady Ingram.  As she
regained her feet, she suddenly saw that the Queen's
son was standing beside his mother.  The formidable
mortal, whom Squire Passmore would have
knocked down as his first greeting, and Patient
have sermonized as an uncovenanted King!
Hardly knowing what she did, Celia knelt again
and kissed the hand that was extended to her.
It was a soft white hand, which did not look as if
it would hold the sceptre very harshly, and on one
finger glittered a large gold ring set with a balas
ruby, upon which a cross was engraved.  Celia
would have regarded that jewel with deep interest
and veneration had she known its romantic history,
stranger than any romance.  This was the last relic
of James's fallen fortunes, the ancient coronation-ring,
"the wedding-ring of England," which had
gleamed from many a royal hand before, and had
been employed to many a strange end.  While
Philip in his turn performed his homage, Celia
studied the royal persons before her.
</p>

<p>
First, the King.  He was tall, very tall[<a id="chap08fn16text"></a><a href="#chap08fn16">16</a>]&mdash;a man
whom few would pass without wondering who he
was; rather thin, but with all this not ungraceful,
and with an air of much distinction about him.
An oval face he had, with a bright complexion; a
forehead smooth and high, but not at all broad;
arched eyebrows; eyes of a dark, rich brown,[<a id="chap08fn17text"></a><a href="#chap08fn17">17</a>] large,
and very soft; a mouth rather too large for strict
proportion, but bearing an expression of mingled
sadness and sweetness, which grew into fascination
when he smiled.  His smiles were rare, and his
voice seldom heard; but very often Celia caught a
momentary upward glance of the eyes, accompanied
by a silent motion of the lips, and she wondered
if it were possible that he was praying.[<a id="chap08fn18text"></a><a href="#chap08fn18">18</a>]  He
wore no wig, only his own dark chestnut hair
curling over his shoulders.
</p>

<p>
This was the King whom England had cast out.
She would have none of him, under any pretext.
Rather than be ruled by this son of her own, she
had set "a stranger over her, which was not her
brother."[<a id="chap08fn19text"></a><a href="#chap08fn19">19</a>]  Celia wondered, for the first time in
her life, whether England had done well.  She
turned with a sigh from the son to the mother,
who was conversing familiarly with Lady Ingram,
seated beside her.
</p>

<p>
The Queen, Maria Beatrice, or Mary, as the
English called her, Celia thought a most fascinating
woman.  She resembled her son in height and
form, being very tall,[<a id="chap08fn20text"></a><a href="#chap08fn20">20</a>] and slender.[<a id="chap08fn21text"></a><a href="#chap08fn21">21</a>]  Her face was
oval,[<a id="chap08fn22text"></a><a href="#chap08fn22">22</a>] her complexion clear and fair, but very pale;[<a id="chap08fn23text"></a><a href="#chap08fn23">23</a>]
her mouth rather large,[<a id="chap08fn24text"></a><a href="#chap08fn24">24</a>] but her smile to Celia
perfectly enchanting; her hair, eyebrows, and eyes
were black.  The eyes were very large, clear, and
brilliant;[<a id="chap08fn25text"></a><a href="#chap08fn25">25</a>] though when they smiled, as they were
doing now&mdash;
</p>

<p class="poem">
  "It was as if remembering they had wept,<br />
  And knowing they should some day weep again."[<a id="chap08fn26text"></a><a href="#chap08fn26">26</a>]<br />
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
"And now tell me all about it, my dear," the
Queen was saying to Lady Ingram.  "Sophia gave
you my message about the Bishop?"
</p>

<p>
"Yes, Madam; and I am quite delighted to think
of it.  Your Majesty is aware that the Tories are
in greater power than ever?"
</p>

<p>
"Dean Atterbury said so in his last note," replied
the Queen, opening her desk, and apparently
searching for the letter.  "He has written often
lately, and very kindly."
</p>

<p>
Celia listened in much surprise, to hear that an
unsuspected Protestant dignitary was in constant
and familiar correspondence with the Court of
St. Germains.[<a id="chap08fn27text"></a><a href="#chap08fn27">27</a>]
</p>

<p>
"Your Majesty has not heard from the Duke?"
</p>

<p>
"From Blenheim? no, not since I saw you: but
the Duchess of Tyrconnel[<a id="chap08fn28text"></a><a href="#chap08fn28">28</a>] was here not long ago,
and she tells me that there seems no hope of the
Duke's return to power."[<a id="chap08fn29text"></a><a href="#chap08fn29">29</a>]
</p>

<p>
Celia's astonishment grew.
</p>

<p>
"Does your Majesty fear that the Princess"&mdash;suggested
Lady Ingram.
</p>

<p>
"No, my dear, no," replied the Queen, rather
sadly; "I do not think she can have discovered.
She is not naturally suspicious, and you know that
the Duchess has been her dearest friend for many
years."
</p>

<p>
"I scarcely think much of that," answered Lady
Ingram.  "Beside, as your Majesty knows, this
woman Abigail, who has crept up to power on the
wreck of hers, and who is a better friend of ours
than ever she was, has all the influence now over
the Princess Anne; and she would doubtless
willingly let her know if she discovered it, simply to
spite the Duchess, and prevent her return to power.
Of course the supplanter would not like to be
supplanted."
</p>

<p>
"I know it, my dear Lady Ingram, I know it,"
responded the Queen, with a sadder air than ever.
</p>

<p>
"Also your Majesty will remember"&mdash;&mdash;But here
Lady Ingram bent forward and spoke low, so that
Celia could hear no more.  She had heard quite
enough already to make her doubtful of the truth
and honesty of everybody in the room but Philip.
</p>

<p>
"Is this your first visit to France?"
</p>

<p>
Celia looked up suddenly to find herself
addressed by the King.
</p>

<p>
"Yes, Sir," she said, hesitating very much,
coloring, and doubting whether, in saying "your
Majesty," she would have been doing right or
wrong.  "Yes, this is my first visit."
</p>

<p>
"Do you like it?"
</p>

<p>
"Not so well as England."
</p>

<p>
"Spoken like a true Englishwoman!" said the
King, with his rare smile.  "Neither do I."
</p>

<p>
Remembering that he had been carried away as
an infant in arms, Celia wondered what he knew
about it.
</p>

<p>
"I hope you are one of my friends?" was the
next question.
</p>

<p>
Celia looked up, blushed, and looked down again.
"I do not know, Sir," she said.
</p>

<p>
"I compliment you on your honesty," said he.
"'Tis a rare quality."
</p>

<p>
Celia was beginning to think it was.
</p>

<p>
"I beg your pardon, Sir," she replied, timidly;
"I was brought up to think otherwise."
</p>

<p>
"Let us hope to convert you," he answered.  "I
assure you that your friends can hope for no great
degree of prosperity till they become mine;[<a id="chap08fn30text"></a><a href="#chap08fn30">30</a>] and
I am not without hopes of changing all England on
that question.  Do you think it impossible?"
</p>

<p>
"I almost do, Sir," said Celia, smiling, and
playing with her fan a little nervously.
</p>

<p>
"We shall see who is right," added the King,
"Ingram, have you seen Colville lately?"
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
"And I assure your Majesty," said Lady Ingram
rising, "that I shall make the fullest inquiries
about it, and direct Sophie to do so."
</p>

<p>
"So be it, my dear," said the Queen, quietly.
"Farewell!  You will bring this little maid again?
I <i>had</i> a daughter&mdash;you know.  In Arcadia&mdash;once!
'<i>Fiat voluntas Tua.</i>'"
</p>

<p>
The last words were spoken very low and falteringly.
The beloved Princess Louise, surnamed by
her father <i>La Consolatrice</i>, had been taken away
from her mother's eyes as with a stroke, only six
weeks before.[<a id="chap08fn31text"></a><a href="#chap08fn31">31</a>]
</p>

<p>
And for one minute Celia forgot dishonesty and
Popery and everything else on the part of the
exiled House, as she looked pityingly into the
tear-dimmed eyes of the almost desolate mother.
There were four graves at Westminster[<a id="chap08fn32text"></a><a href="#chap08fn32">32</a>] beside
the one at Chaillot, and the young man who stood
beside the Queen was the last of her children:
"the only son of his mother, and she was a widow!"[<a id="chap08fn33text"></a><a href="#chap08fn33">33</a>]
</p>

<p>
And the verdict Celia whispered to her own
heart at the close was&mdash;"Yes, England has done
well&mdash;has done right.  But oh, if it had not been
necessary!"
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
"Chocolate!" announced Mr. Philip Ingram to
himself, simultaneously with the presentation of
himself at his sister's boudoir-door.  "Patient, bring
me a cup&mdash;there's a good soul.  Why, how long is
it before supper?"
</p>

<p>
"Scarcely two hours, I know," said Celia; "but
I had very little dinner, and I am hungry."
</p>

<p>
"You dined on your coming interview with the
Queen, did you?  Well, how do you like her?"
</p>

<p>
"I like her face very much, and feel very sorry
for her."
</p>

<p>
"You like her face!" repeated Philip, putting
his hands in his pockets.  "What a droll answer!
Do you mean that you dislike her voice, or what
part of her?"
</p>

<p>
"Nothing in that way.  Philip, I wonder if
there is a scrap of honesty left in the world!"
</p>

<p>
"Precious little, my dear&mdash;I can tell you that.
Patient, you are a diamond of the first water!"  The
last remark by way of receipt for the chocolate.
</p>

<p>
"Well, I think so!  I never could have
imagined that such men as the Duke of Marlborough
and Dean Atterbury were eating the Queen's bread,
and deceiving her every day by writing to these
people and offering help."
</p>

<p>
Philip laughed.  "So that is what has angered
and astonished you?  Why, any man in Paris could
have told you that months ago.  'Tis no secret, my
innocence&mdash;from any but the Princess Anne."
</p>

<p>
"'Tis rank dishonesty!" exclaimed Celia, warmly.
"I don't complain of their helping this Court,
but of their want of truth.  If they are Jacobites,
let them have the manliness to say so."
</p>

<p>
"You are such an innocent!" responded Philip,
still laughing.  "Why, my simple little sister, all
is fair in politics, as in love and war."
</p>

<p>
"I don't see that 'all is fair' in any of the three.
What is right is right, and what is wrong is wrong."
</p>

<p>
"Excellent, my logical damsel!  But what are
right and wrong?  That is the first question.  Is
there a certain abstract thing called right or
virtue? or does right differ according to the views or
circumstances of the actor?"
</p>

<p>
"I do not understand you, Philip.  To do right
is to obey God, and to do wrong is to disobey
God.  There was no wrong in Adam's and Eve's
eating fruit: what made it wrong was God's
having forbidden them to touch that one tree.
St. Paul says, 'Where no law is there is no
transgression.'"[<a id="chap08fn34text"></a><a href="#chap08fn34">34</a>]
</p>

<p>
"Upon my word, you are a regular divine!  But&mdash;leaving
St. Paul on one side for the present&mdash;how,
according to your theory, shall we discover
what is wrong?"
</p>

<p>
"Just by not leaving St. Paul on one side,"
answered Celia, smiling; "for the Bible is given us
for that purpose."
</p>

<p>
"Very few definite rules are to be found in the
Bible, my doctor of divinity."
</p>

<p>
"Quite enough for all of us, Philip."
</p>

<p>
"Pardon me!  The very thing, I think, is, that
there are not enough.  A few more 'thou shalts'
and 'thou shalt nots' would be of infinite service.
Your view, if I understand it, is to bring the Bible
to bear upon every act of life; but how you
contrive to do so I can't imagine.  Now, look here!
I will give you a case, my fair casuist.  Would it
be right or wrong for me, at this moment, sitting
on this sofa, to take a pinch of snuff?"
</p>

<p>
"I must ask you a few questions before I can
answer."
</p>

<p>
"Catechize, by all means.  'What is my name?'  Philip
Eugene.  'Who gave me this name?'  Don't
recollect in the least.  'What did they do for
me?'  Why, one of them gave me a gold goblet, and
another a set of silver Apostle-spoons:[<a id="chap08fn35text"></a><a href="#chap08fn35">35</a>] and I am
not aware that they did anything else for me."
</p>

<p>
"Philip, Philip!" remonstrated Celia, laughing in
spite of herself.  "Please don't let us jest upon
these serious subjects.  I don't want to ask those
questions."
</p>

<p>
"Well, I won't jest, my dear.  I will be very
quiet and grave."
</p>

<p>
"Does your mother object to your taking snuff?"
</p>

<p>
"Not exactly.  I don't think she much likes it."
</p>

<p>
"Then your question is answered.  If she does
not like it, it is&mdash;for you&mdash;wrong."
</p>

<p>
"Oh! you arrive at your conclusions in that
roundabout sort of way?  That is rather clever
but I will see if I cannot puzzle you yet."
</p>

<p>
"I have no doubt you can, very easily," said
Celia.  "You may readily propound fifty such
cases which I could not answer.  You see, those
are not my circumstances: and we can scarce
expect that God will give us grace to see what is
right in difficulties which He does not lay upon us.
Do you not think so, Patient?"
</p>

<p>
"I do so, Madam.  I have ever found it harder
to see the way out when I had hedged up mine
own way, than when the Lord, as with Noah, had
shut me in."
</p>

<p>
"Ah! there you come round to your divinity,"
said Philip, lightly.  "Whatever I ask you, you
always centre there; and Patient will say Amen to
all your propositions, I have no doubt.  But to
return to our point of departure: I hardly see
your 'rank dishonesty' in the acts of the Court.
I believe this&mdash;that if the Queen thought it
dishonest, she would not do it.  She is considered
here a very religious woman: not in your way, I
dare say.  But we freethinkers, you know, do not
set much value on small differences.  If a man be
sincere, that is the chief thing; even some of the
more enlightened of the Catholic Fathers allow
that.  Does not the Bible say that there are
twelve gates to Heaven?[<a id="chap08fn36text"></a><a href="#chap08fn36">36</a>]  There is a reference
for you."
</p>

<p>
"A reference that'll no hold water, Mr. Philip,"
said Patient, looking up.  "For though there be
twelve gates into the City, there's only door into
the Fold:[<a id="chap08fn37text"></a><a href="#chap08fn37">37</a>] and I'll be fain to know how you are
shaping, without passing the one door, to get in at
any of the twelve gates.  For whoso 'entereth not
in by the door into the sheepfold, but climbeth up
some other way, the same is a thief and a robber.'"[<a id="chap08fn38text"></a><a href="#chap08fn38">38</a>]
</p>

<p>
"Philip," added Celia, softly, "there is but one
gate and one way to life, which is Jesus Christ."
</p>

<p>
"Ah! at it again!" said Philip, lifting his
eyebrows, and finishing his chocolate.
</p>

<p>
"Always at it," answered Celia, in the same
tone.  "'Out of the abundance of the heart the
mouth' must speak.[<a id="chap08fn39text"></a><a href="#chap08fn39">39</a>]  Philip, your idea about
sincerity will lead you terribly astray&mdash;I am sure
it will.  There is but one truth; and if a man
believe falsehood, will his thinking it truth make it
so?  Sincerity is not the chief thing.  The chief
things are faith and love in us, and the Lord Jesus
Christ out of us.  'He that hath the Son hath life:
and he that hath not the Son of God hath not
life.'[<a id="chap08fn40text"></a><a href="#chap08fn40">40</a>]  O Philip! listen to me this once!  'It is
not a vain thing for thee, because it is thy life!'"[<a id="chap08fn41text"></a><a href="#chap08fn41">41</a>]
</p>

<p>
Philip looked into his sister's earnest eyes, rose
and kissed her, and sat down again.
</p>

<p>
"You are a capital little sister," he said, "and
admirably cut out for a <i>réligieuse</i>.  I am quite glad
the Protestants don't take to that amusement, or
I should certainly lose you, and I like you too well
to afford it."
</p>

<p>
Celia sighed.  Her words did not appear to
have made the faintest impression.
</p>

<p>
"What a sigh!" said Philip.  "My dear little
Celia! do you take me for an utter reprobate, that
you think it necessary to mourn over me in that
way?"
</p>

<p>
"Philip," said Celia, very solemnly, "a man
must be either inside the sheepfold of Jesus, or
outside it.  Without is without, whether the door
which he refuses to enter be a yard from him or a
thousand miles.  Without the Fold now, without
the City hereafter.  And 'without are dogs, and
sorcerers, and whoremongers, and murderers, and
idolaters, and whosoever loveth and maketh a
lie.'"[<a id="chap08fn42text"></a><a href="#chap08fn42">42</a>]
</p>

<p>
"I know mighty few people who are in, then,"
said Philip, whistling, and considering the carpet.
</p>

<p>
"I am afraid so," answered Celia, shortly.
"But the one question for us, Philip, is&mdash;Are <i>we</i>
in?"
</p>

<p>
A question to which Mr. Philip Ingram made no
reply.

"My Dearest Mother,&mdash;(For I cannot bear to
call you anything else)&mdash;I have so much to
tell you that I know not where to begin.  I am
now, as you will see by my date, at St. Germains,
which is a rather pretty place.  My step-mother is
kind to me, in her way, which is not exactly your
way; but I am quite comfortable, so pray be not
troubled about me.  I like Philip, my younger
brother, very much; he oft reminds me of Charley.
My elder brother, Edward, I have not yet seen, he
being now absent from home.  I have seen the
Pretender and the late Queen Mary,[<a id="chap09fn1text"></a><a href="#chap09fn1">1</a>] both of whom
are very tall persons, having dark hair and eyes.
I have made no friends here but one; you shall
hear about her shortly.  So much for my news.
</p>

<p>
"And now I wish very much to hear yours.
Are you all well?  And pray tell me anything of
note concerning any person whom I know.  All
news from England has great interest for me now.
</p>

<p>
"Pray give all manner of loving messages for
me.  Tell my dear father that the people here hunt
a great deal, but always stags.  There is no
cock-fighting, at which I am glad, for 'tis but a cruel
sport to my thinking; nor no baiting nor wrestling,
but a great deal of duelling.  I like the French
gentlemen ill, and the ladies worse.  Bell should
come here to see the modes; 'twould give her
infinite pleasure.  I can speak French tolerable
well now, and if my father and you choose, could
teach Lucy on my return.  For I am looking
forward to that, Mother dear&mdash;sometimes very much
indeed.  To think that 'tis six months, nearly, since
I saw one of you! and if you have writ I have not
had your letters.  If aught should bring Harry to
Paris, do pray bid him visit me; I should be so
infinitely glad.  Pray give my love to Cicely, and
tell her I would she knew my woman here, whom I
like mightily, and so would she.  I hope Charley
is a good boy, and that Lucy tries to fill my place
with you.  At the end of this month, if my Lady
Ingram say nought, I shall ask her when she will
part with me.  I beg that you will write to me, if
'twere but a line.  Indeed I should like dearly to
hear from every one of you.  Anything you like to
write will be infinitely welcome to&mdash;

<p>
Celia folded her letter, addressed it, and sat
thinking.  How would they receive it?  She
pictured Lucy rushing into the parlor, waving it
above her head, and Isabella languidly rebuking
her for her rough entrance.  She could guess the
Squire's comments on many things she had said,
and she knew that the very mention of the
Pretender would call forth some strong participles.
Madam Passmore would fold up the letter with
"Dear child!" and drop it into her ample pocket.
Cicely would courtesy and ask if Mrs. Celia was
a-coming.  One month more, and then surely Lady
Ingram must be satisfied.  But then came another
thought.  She would be very sorry to leave Philip
and Patient, even to return to Ashcliffe.  Would
Lady Ingram be induced to let her take Patient
with her?  As to Philip, surely he could visit her
if he chose.
</p>

<p>
"Mademoiselle!" said the voice of Thérèse
beside her.
</p>

<p>
Celia turned, and saw that Thérèse was holding
a little pink note, which having delivered, the
French maid departed.  She broke the seal, and
discovered to her surprise that the note was from
Lady Ingram herself.  It ran thus:
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
"MY DAUGHTER,&mdash;I shall not be able to receive
you this afternoon, as I am suffering from
megrims.[<a id="chap09fn3text"></a><a href="#chap09fn3">3</a>]  I will send Philip to keep you
company.  I wish you to know that when I return to
Paris, which will be in four days, I will lead you to
kiss the hand of the King of France.  After this
you will be able to enter into company.
</p>

<p class="noindent">
"CLAUDE INGRAM."
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
Celia dropped the note in the trepidation which
it caused her.  She had no desire to be presented
to the originator of the Dragonnades.  And what
was "entering into company?"  She was sure it
meant what she would not like, and might think
actually wrong.
</p>

<p>
"Do you drive out this afternoon, Madam?"
asked Patient, appearing at the door.
</p>

<p>
"No, Patient," said Celia, hesitatingly, for she
was still thinking of the note.  "Mr. Philip will
drink a dish of chocolate with me here."
</p>

<p>
"Yes, Madam," replied Patient, and disappeared.
</p>

<p>
Celia changed her dress with a heavy heart,
and came back into her boudoir, where preparations
for the chocolate were made.  She found Mr. Philip
Ingram very comfortably established on her sofa.
</p>

<p>
"Good evening, Madam," observed that gentleman,
without any alteration in his attitude of
repose.
</p>

<p>
"Philip, what is it to go into company?"
</p>

<p>
"To dress fine and tell lies.  Why?"
</p>

<p>
Celia gave him the note in answer.
</p>

<p>
"Ah!" remarked he.  "Megrims, has she?  Let
me see now&mdash;the megrims are Père Letellier; yes,
Père Dumain is a cold on the chest."
</p>

<p>
"What do you mean, Philip?" asked Celia, in
bewilderment.
</p>

<p>
"Only my Lady-Mother's style of cipher
correspondence, my dear.  She gives an occasional <i>séance</i>
to her spiritual advisers, on which occasion she
tells the world&mdash;fibs."
</p>

<p>
"You do not really mean it?"
</p>

<p>
"Of course I do."
</p>

<p>
"But what does she do?"
</p>

<p>
"In her <i>séance</i>?  Confesses her sins&mdash;that is, so
far as I can judge from my recollection of one such
occurrence at which I was present when a small
kitten, she regales her spiritual pastor with some
very spicy tales of all her friends and acquaintances."
</p>

<p>
"I am sure you are joking, Philip.  But please
tell me what it is that she wants me to do?  Is it
to go to all her assemblies?"
</p>

<p>
"Precisely, my Grey Sister&mdash;and to a few Court
balls, and a play or two."
</p>

<p>
"O dear!" sighed poor Celia.  "I never can do <i>that</i>,"
</p>

<p>
"Don't sigh in that heart-rending style," said
Philip.  "As to assemblies, there will not be above
three more this summer, and we may be in China
by next year.  What is your special grief?"
</p>

<p>
"It looks like conformity to the world," answered
Celia, in a low tone, for she did not expect Philip
to understand her.
</p>

<p>
"Where is the world?" laughed that irreverent
young gentleman.  "That superb satin gown of
yours, or the chocolate, or the talk?  Eh, Patient?
What do you say, my veteran prioress?"
</p>

<p>
"In your heart, Mr. Philip," answered Patient,
setting down the chocolate-pot which she had just
brought in.  "The world outside, and an evil
worldly human heart within, will work no little
mischief.  I'll warrant it did <i>Him</i> no harm dining
with the Pharisee[<a id="chap09fn4text"></a><a href="#chap09fn4">4</a>]&mdash;not that Simon was an
over-pleasant man to do with, I should say: and when
your heart is as pure and holy as His, why, Sir,
I'm thinking you may go, and welcome.  But I've
work enough cut out for me in keeping the devil
without mine own door, without calling at his to
ask how he fareth."
</p>

<p>
"Thank you, Dr. Patient.  Rather a short sermon.
Celia, my dear, I have a scrap of information
for you which will make you open your eyes."
</p>

<p>
"The shortest sermon I ever heard of was one
of the most salutary, Sir,&mdash;to wit, when Nathan
said to poor sinful David, 'Thou art the man!'"[<a id="chap09fn5text"></a><a href="#chap09fn5">5</a>]
</p>

<p>
"You are very disrespectful to His Israelitish
Majesty," said Philip, lightly.  "Well, Mrs. Celia,
know that I have succeeded at last in obtaining
her Ladyship's leave, and the King's commission,
to go into the army.  Lieutenant Ingram, Madam,
at your service!" and Philip rose and made a bow
which would not have disgraced Monsieur Bontems.
</p>

<p>
"Philip!  Are you really a lieutenant?"
</p>

<p>
"Really.  And the best half of the battle is the
battle.  There is a prospect of the troops being
called to active service."
</p>

<p>
Celia turned pale.
</p>

<p>
"Does your mother know that?"
</p>

<p>
"No."
</p>

<p>
"O Philip! you have not been deceiving her,
have you?"
</p>

<p>
"Smooth your ruffled brow, my fair reprover.  I
did not know it myself until after His Majesty had
promised me a commission.  Of course, after this
I must be a fervent Jacobite.  So don't you talk
any politics in my hearing, Mrs. Patient Irvine,
unless you wish me to fight you."
</p>

<p>
"I shall scarce be like to do that, Sir, unless you
give me the starting," quietly responded Patient.
</p>

<p>
"Thank you, no!  I will keep my hands off that
gunpowder-magazine.  I know how you can go off
sometimes when touched by a few odd matches.
So, my charmer, your interview with me on the
18th of next month will be the last for a while."
</p>

<p>
"Where are you going, Philip?"
</p>

<p>
"We march to the Netherlands Border, and
meet Prince Eugene.  We are to be at Landrécies
by the 10th of July."[<a id="chap09fn6text"></a><a href="#chap09fn6">6</a>]
</p>

<p>
"Mr. Philip, you shall not go hence without a
Bible in your knapsack."
</p>

<p>
"Thank you very much.  Am I to read it when
I am not firing?"
</p>

<p>
"If I could help it, Sir, you would not go without
one other thing, but that I cannot give you."
</p>

<p>
"What thing may that be?"
</p>

<p>
"The grace of God in your heart, Sir."
</p>

<p>
"You think me entirely devoid of it?" asked
Philip, gravely.
</p>

<p>
"I do so, Mr. Philip," said Patient, looking him
full in the face.
</p>

<p>
"Well, you are candid, if not complimentary,"
said he.  "'Tis fortunate for me that my conscience
gives a rather fairer report than you do.  I wish
Edward were back.  I should like to have gone
into battle under dear old Ned's wing, and I'm in
his own regiment, too.  He must have got an awful
furlough."
</p>

<p>
"Your conscience, Sir!" exclaimed Patient, in a
peculiar voice.  "Do you think that when Adam
fell he left his conscience out?"
</p>

<p>
"My dear Patient, I wonder what you mean?
God has given to every man his conscience as his
ruler, counsellor, and guide.  He who hearkens to
his conscience is hearkening to God."
</p>

<p>
Patient did not answer at once.  Then she said:
</p>

<p>
"Sir, I desire to speak with due reverence of the
Lord's dealings.  But 'tis my true belief that he did
nothing of the kind you say.  He gave, 'tis true, a
guide to every man; but that guide was His own
blessed Word and His own Holy Spirit, not the
man's poor, miserable, fallen conscience.  Truly,
I would not take my conscience, which is myself,
to be my 'ruler, counsellor and guide.'  One is my
Ruler, which is in heaven.  One is my Counsellor&mdash;the
Wonderful Counsellor.[<a id="chap09fn7text"></a><a href="#chap09fn7">7</a>]  And one is my Guide&mdash;the
Spirit, in the Word which He hath written.
Conscience given us for a guide, Mr. Philip!
Why, Paul went according to his conscience when
he kept the clothes of them that stoned Stephen.[<a id="chap09fn8text"></a><a href="#chap09fn8">8</a>]  Peter
went according to his conscience when he
withdrew himself from them that were not of the
circumcision, and refused to eat with them.[<a id="chap09fn9text"></a><a href="#chap09fn9">9</a>]  Alexander
the coppersmith very like went according to
his conscience when he did the Church much evil.[<a id="chap09fn10text"></a><a href="#chap09fn10">10</a>]  To
come to our own day, I dare be bold to guess
that King Charles went according to his
conscience,&mdash;Charles the First, I mean; I doubt his son had
none.  And Claverhouse, and this King Lewis, and
the Pretender&mdash;ay, the Pope himself, poor old
sinner!&mdash;I'll be bound they go according to their
consciences.  Nay, nay, Mr. Philip!  When Adam fell
in Eden, surely his conscience fell with him.  And
just as there can be nothing more sweet and gracious
than an enlightened conscience and a sanctified
will, so there is little worse than a blind
conscience and a carnal will."
</p>

<p>
"You have such a curious set of arguments as I
never heard.  You are for ever talking about the
fall of Adam, which you seem to fancy accounts
for the falls and slips of you and me.  I never
knew Adam, I am sure, and I don't hold myself
responsible for his taste in apples.  How do you
know that Adam 'fell,' as you are pleased to call
it?  And supposing that he did, what in the name
of common sense has that to do with me?"
</p>

<p>
"It has more to do with you than you think for,
Mr. Philip.  As Christ is the Head of His saved
Church, so is Adam the head of the whole family
of man.  'In Adam all die.'[<a id="chap09fn11text"></a><a href="#chap09fn11">11</a>]  And as to knowing
that Adam fell, to say nought of the Lord's record
of it, I scarce think I need more evidence of that
than your doubting it, Sir.  If you can look upon
this world, as it is at this moment, and doubt that
man is a fallen, lost, ruined, miserable creature,
there must be something sore wrong with the eyes
of your understanding."
</p>

<p>
"Or of yours," suggested Philip.  "Oh, I see
evil enough in the world, I warrant you: but I
see good along with it.  Now the principle you
are fond of laying down is according to a text
which I think you have quoted to me twenty
times&mdash;'In us dwelleth no good thing.'"[<a id="chap09fn12text"></a><a href="#chap09fn12">12</a>]
</p>

<p>
"I wish you thought so, Mr. Philip."
</p>

<p>
"Thank you for wishing me such an agreeable
view of myself.  But while you are fixing your
eyes intently on all the evil in the world, you
leave the good unseen."
</p>

<p>
"Would you kindly point it out to me, Sir?"
</p>

<p>
"Willingly.  Take only one point.  There are
hosts of people in the world&mdash;Catholics and others,
even Mahometans and idolaters, I dare say&mdash;whom
you would consign kindly and certainly to
everlasting perdition"&mdash;
</p>

<p>
"I consign no man to perdition, Sir.  The keys
of hell and of death are not in my hands, thank
God!  But I read of 'the son of perdition,'[<a id="chap09fn13text"></a><a href="#chap09fn13">13</a>] who
went to his own place.'"[<a id="chap09fn14text"></a><a href="#chap09fn14">14</a>]
</p>

<p>
"Well, among all these very wicked people,
there is a vast deal of charity.  Is that good or
bad?"
</p>

<p>
"Charity is good, Sir," said Patient, cautiously.
"Paul would have counted himself nothing worth
if he had not charity.[<a id="chap09fn15text"></a><a href="#chap09fn15">15</a>]  But"&mdash;
</p>

<p>
"Then they are good for indulging it?" interrupted
Philip.
</p>

<p>
"Sir, 'charity' is a much misused word.  You
are speaking of mere alms, the which are good for
them that receive them, if they use them rightly;
and good for them that give them, when given in a
right spirit.  But these are no more evidence of a
man's standing before God"&mdash;
</p>

<p>
"Patient Irvine, have you read the Twenty-fifth
chapter of Saint Matthew?"
</p>

<p>
"I have read the Twenty-fifth of Matthew, Sir,"
answered Patient, dryly, leaving out the "Saint."
</p>

<p>
"And are not the good people commended in
that chapter, and do they not obtain everlasting
life, simply and solely for their charity to the
poor?"
</p>

<p>
"No, Sir," said Patient, placidly.
</p>

<p>
"Well, upon my word!" exclaimed Philip.
</p>

<p>
"Sir," resumed Patient, gravely, "it takes but a
kindly heart to give alms for its own sake, or for
the receiver's sake.  But it takes a renewed heart
to give alms for Christ's sake.  Not the giving of
alms was the title to life everlasting, but the
giving them 'unto Him'[<a id="chap09fn16text"></a><a href="#chap09fn16">16</a>] was the seal and evidence
of their grace.  They that know Christ will look
for a savor of Him in all things, and such as have
it not are bitter unto them.  And I would call to
your mind, Sir, that 'tis 'he that believeth'[<a id="chap09fn17text"></a><a href="#chap09fn17">17</a>] which
shall be saved: not he which giveth alms.  At
least, there is no such passage in <i>my</i> Bible."
</p>

<p>
"You always run off to something else," said
Philip, discontentedly.  "However, to come back
to our first point&mdash;as to my conscience, begging
your pardon, and with your gracious leave, I think
that God has given it to me as a guide, and that I
am bound to follow it."
</p>

<p>
Patient laid down her work, and looked Philip
in the face.
</p>

<p>
"I read in the Word, Mr. Philip, of different
sorts of consciences.  There is a defiled
conscience.  'Unto them that are defiled and
unbelieving is nothing pure; but even their mind and
conscience is defiled.'[<a id="chap09fn18text"></a><a href="#chap09fn18">18</a>]  There is an evil
conscience.  'Having our hearts sprinkled from an
evil conscience;'[<a id="chap09fn19text"></a><a href="#chap09fn19">19</a>] and nought in earth or heaven
will sprinkle them to this end save the blood of
Christ.  There is a conscience lost and smothered
in dead works.  'How much more shall the blood
of Christ ... purge your conscience from dead
works?'[<a id="chap09fn20text"></a><a href="#chap09fn20">20</a>]  Now, Mr. Philip, see your 'good' and
charity to the poor.  <i>Works</i>, you see: but, coming
from dead hearts and souls&mdash;<i>dead</i> works.  And
lastly, deepest and deadliest of all, I read of a
conscience 'seared with a hot iron.'[<a id="chap09fn21text"></a><a href="#chap09fn21">21</a>]  Ay, there have
been some of those in our day.  The Lord protect
us from it!  The devil hath such a grip of them
that they cannot free themselves; and, poor
blind souls! they never know it, but think they
are doing God's service.  Are these consciences
given as guides, Mr. Philip?"
</p>

<p>
"Well, you see, all that is Saint Peter's opinion."
</p>

<p>
"I ask you pardon, 'tis Paul, not Peter.'
</p>

<p>
"Oh, St. Paul?  Well, 'tis all the same."
</p>

<p>
"Ay, Mr. Philip, it is all the same, for it was
the Holy Ghost that spake through both of them.
And <i>His</i> opinion is scarce to be dealt with so
lightly, methinks, seeing that by His word we
shall be judged at the last day."
</p>

<p>
Patient took up her work again, and said no
more.  Philip was silent for a time: when he next
spoke it was on a different subject.
</p>

<p>
"Celia, I want you to come down at my mother's
next assembly.  I should like to present my friend
Colville to you."
</p>

<p>
"I am rather curious to see him," she admitted.
</p>

<p>
"Mr. Philip, if I might presume to say a word"&mdash;
</p>

<p>
"'Presume to say a word!' you may presume to
say a thousand, my dear old Covenanter.  What's
in the wind now?"
</p>

<p>
"I wish you went less about with that Mr. Colville."
</p>

<p>
"Why?  Does he wear his cravats without
starch?" asked Philip, stretching himself out lazily.
</p>

<p>
"I am afraid, Mr. Philip, that he wears his soul
without grace," said Patient, determinately.  "If
he were such another as his grandsire, I would
wish no better than to see you in his company.
But I am sore afraid that he draws you off, Sir, to
places where you should not go."
</p>

<p>
"He never draws me off, Reverend Mother, to
any place where I don't choose to go, I assure
you.  He would find that a hard matter."
</p>

<p>
"The case is scarce bettered by that, Mr. Philip,"
replied Patient, mournfully.  "Nay, rather
worsened, I'm thinking.  O Mr. Philip! bear
with me, Sir, for I have sobbed many a prayer
over your cradle, and many a wrestle have I had
with the Lord for a blessing on your soul.  You
little ken, Sir, how even now, whenever I see you
go out with that Mr. Colville, I lay the case before
the Lord at once.  I could not rest else."
</p>

<p>
"My dear old darling!" said Philip, smiling,
and very affectionately, "I wish you did not look
at me through such very black spectacles.  There
are better men than I am&mdash;many a one; but I
hope there are a few worse."
</p>

<p>
"That won't satisfy me, Sir," answered Patient.
"I would have Sir Edward and you the two best
men in the world."
</p>

<p>
"And we are not!&mdash;at least I am not; I am not
sure that Ned is not.  What a pity!"
</p>

<p>
"Ay, Mr. Philip, a bitterer pity than you'll ken
till you come to stand before God.  I have
watched you for years, Sir, like a mother her
babe, trusting to see you quietened and calmed by
grace: and to-night you seem to me lighter and
gayer than ever.  'Tis no manner of use&mdash;no manner
of use.  'I have labored in vain; I have spent
my strength for nought.'"[<a id="chap09fn22text"></a><a href="#chap09fn22">22</a>]
</p>

<p>
"Dear Patient," said Celia, as the door closed
on Philip, "have you forgotten that verse we read
last Sunday&mdash;'Though Israel be not gathered, yet
shall I be glorious in the eyes of the Lord, and
my God shall be my strength.'[<a id="chap09fn23text"></a><a href="#chap09fn23">23</a>]  It comes, you
know, just after the text you repeated."
</p>

<p>
"Ou ay, Mrs. Celia," answered Patient, dropping
into Scotch, as was usual with her when
deeply stirred,&mdash;"ou ay, I mind that word.  But
it was the gathering I wanted, Madam&mdash;it was the
gathering!"
</p>

<p>
Back in Paris, and once more attired in full
court costume, Celia somewhat sadly joined her
step-mother.  This visit to the Tuileries was even
more distasteful to her than that she had paid at
St. Germains.  The idea of kneeling to kiss the
hand of the man who had ordered the Dragonnades,
came, she thought, very near the border of
absolute wrong; at the same time, she did not
feel so certain of the wrong as to make her resist
Lady Ingram's order.  Her position was exceedingly
disagreeable, since, while she could not be
sure that she was doing wrong, she felt very
doubtful whether she was doing right.  Philip
tried to rally her upon her sorrowful face, but his
banter fell flat, and he looked puzzled and
compassionate.
</p>

<p>
"I am ready, my dear," said Lady Ingram as
she came in.  "But what a face!  Do you think
that I am taking you to see an execution?"
</p>

<p>
"Madam," said Celia, summoning all her
courage, "I wish your Ladyship would allow me to
remain at home."
</p>

<p>
"Is this wicked, my votaress?" asked Lady
Ingram, with the scornful smile which by this
time her step-daughter knew so well.
</p>

<p>
"I cannot say that, Madam; but I am not
quite sure that it is right.  Does your Ladyship
wish me particularly to accompany you?"
</p>

<p>
"Of course I do, my clear.  'Tis an opportunity
which it would be a sin to lose.  You consider it a
venial sin, I suppose.  Well, you can say another
prayer or two."
</p>

<p>
"I know nothing about venial sins, Madam.  Sin
is sin to me; but as I am not sure that this is a
sin, if your Ladyship absolutely commands me, I
will go: at the same time, I would much rather
remain."
</p>

<p>
"Ah!  I know what that means, my <i>réligieuse</i>,"
said Lady Ingram, laughing; "you want an excuse
for your conscience.  Very well, then, I
command you.  The coach is here.  Come!"
</p>

<p>
Celia followed slowly.  Lady Ingram had
entirely misunderstood her&mdash;in all probability was
incapable of understanding her.  Any further
explanation, she felt, would merely plunge her
deeper into the mire; so she sat grave and silent
until the carriage drew up on one side of the Place
du Carrousel.  Lady Ingram gave her hand as
usual to Philip, and Celia followed them in silence.
After the customary passage through suites of
rooms, they paused at a door; and on giving a
gentle tap, a gentleman in black came out and
bowed low before them.
</p>

<p>
"Madam," said he, "my duty is my duty.  I
regret unspeakably to be constrained to inform
you that His Most Christian Majesty can receive
no person to-day."
</p>

<p>
"I regret it exceedingly also," answered Lady
Ingram.  "I can proceed, I suppose, to visit the
ladies?"
</p>

<p>
"Certainly, Madam."
</p>

<p>
Lady Ingram turned off through further suites
of apartments, and the gentleman in black,
straightening himself up, disappeared again
behind the door.  Celia felt relieved.  There
could be nothing wrong, she thought, in paying
respect to the Queen and Princesses, to whom she
supposed Lady Ingram to refer; and she followed
with a lighter step and heart than before.  Her
ignorance of the state of the Royal Family of
France was very great indeed.  That state, in the
summer of 1712, was a strange and lamentable
one.  There was no Queen, yet the King was
married; there were no Princesses save one, the
Duchess de Berry, yet three of the King's
daughters sat round his table every evening.
</p>

<p>
"Now, Celia!" said Lady Ingram, looking back,
"we will pay our respects first to the Duchess de
Berry."
</p>

<p>
"Who is the Duchess de Berry?" Celia inquired
softly of Philip.
</p>

<p>
"The wife of the King's grandson," he whispered
in reply.
</p>

<p>
The Duchess de Berry could receive them,
they were told, on asking; and the gentleman
usher opened the inner door, and gave access to a
large and handsome room, wherein about two
dozen ladies and gentlemen were seated at a table,
playing cards.  A much larger number stood round
the room, close to the walls, watching the players.
Lady Ingram made her way to a very young girl
who sat at one end of the lansquenet-table, and
who, Celia thought, was scarcely seventeen.  This
surely could be the wife of nobody, she mentally
decided.
</p>

<p>
The girl certainly looked very young.  Celia, on
consideration, doubted if she were seventeen.  A
soft, bright, innocent face she had, laughing eyes,
and a blooming complexion.  She looked up with
a smile as Lady Ingram approached her, and said
a few words in a low tone.  Lady Ingram took off
her gloves, and sat down quietly at the lansquenet-table,
having apparently forgotten her companions.
</p>

<p>
"Are we to remain here?" asked Celia of Philip,
in a tone inaudible to any one but himself.
</p>

<p>
"Wait a minute, till I see the result of her first
venture," answered Philip, biting his lip.
</p>

<p>
Celia looked back at the card-table.  She was
accustomed to see Squire Passmore play cards,
but never for money, except when he received or
went into company; and even then, a few half-crowns
were all that changed hands.  She gazed
with surprise on the piles and rouleaux of gold
which lay upon this table, and the quantity of
loose pieces scattered about.  Hands were
constantly extended with a dozen or two of louis in
them, and one lady in particular Celia noticed, who
piled up her gold until the tower would go no
higher, and each time staked the heap on a single
card.
</p>

<p>
"Who is that girl next my Lady Ingram, at the
end of the table?" Celia next inquired of her
brother.
</p>

<p>
"That is the Duchess de Berry," said he.
</p>

<p>
"That the Duchess!  Why, Philip! she is scarce
more than a child!"
</p>

<p>
"She is the mother of two children herself,"
replied Philip.  "Perhaps you guess her younger
than she is&mdash;eighteen."
</p>

<p>
"She looks so young and innocent," said Celia.
</p>

<p>
"Young, yes&mdash;but innocent!  My dear, this girl
of eighteen is already one of the worst women in
France.  Deuce-ace&mdash;ah! She will go on.  We
may go."
</p>

<p>
Philip slipped round the table to his mother's
side, and whispered a few words to her, to which
she responded without turning her head.  Coming
back to Celia, he gave her his hand and led her
out of the room.
</p>

<p>
"Is my Lady not coming?" she asked, glancing back.
</p>

<p>
"Not when she has thrown deuce-ace," said
Philip, dryly.  "She considers that her lucky
number, and always goes on playing when it comes
at the first throw.  Now come with me for half-an-hour.
You will see a little of Court-life, and you
shall go home when you are tired.  We will visit
the great drawing-room."
</p>

<p>
He led her into a large, handsome room, hung
with crimson.  Round the apartment lines of
spectators, three or four deep, were standing, and
at a very large table in the midst about forty more
were seated.  The game played here also was
lansquenet, for such immense losses had occurred
at basset that the King had forbidden the latter
game in all rooms but the private boudoirs of the
Princesses.
</p>

<p>
"Have we any right here, Philip?" whispered
Celia, doubtfully.
</p>

<p>
"Yes," said Philip, coolly.  "Any person known
to the gentlemen-ushers can enter.  Come round a
little to the right&mdash;there is more room, and you
will see better.  I will be your directory.  That
gentleman with the blue coat and the orders on his
breast, at the top of the table, is the Duke of
Orleans.[<a id="chap09fn24text"></a><a href="#chap09fn24">24</a>]  If the King die while his heir is under
age, as is most likely, that man will be Regent of
France.  He is considered a clever fellow."
</p>

<p>
Celia looked, and saw a man of middle height,
and about forty years of age.  He had bright eyes,
a laughing mouth, a florid complexion, and a thick,
flat nose.  The hand which held his cards was as
small, white, and delicate as that of a woman.
</p>

<p>
"And who are the ladies beside him?" Celia
wished to know.
</p>

<p>
"On the right, his cousin, the Grand Duchess of
Tuscany,[<a id="chap09fn25text"></a><a href="#chap09fn25">25</a>] and on the left another cousin,[<a id="chap09fn26text"></a><a href="#chap09fn26">26</a>] the
Princess of Conti.  Next to her is her half-sister,
the Duke's wife."[<a id="chap09fn27text"></a><a href="#chap09fn27">27</a>]
</p>

<p>
"I do not quite like the Grand Duchess's face."
</p>

<p>
"She is not considered particularly amiable.
One of her sisters[<a id="chap09fn28text"></a><a href="#chap09fn28">28</a>] was married to the Duke de
Guise, which was so marvellous a condescension
that the poor man might never eat his dinner
without his wife's leave.  Every day he stood beside
her chair, and presented her dinner-napkin: the
cover was laid for her only; and he might not
presume to help himself even to a biscuit until Her
Royal Highness was graciously pleased to command
a plate and chair to be brought for Monsieur
de Guise.  Then he made a low, grateful bow to
his very superior wife, and might sit down and
dine."
</p>

<p>
"Is that really true, Philip?" asked Celia,
laughing softly.
</p>

<p>
"Perfectly true."
</p>

<p>
Celia turned her attention to the Princess of
Conti.  She liked to look at her fair, quiet face,
with its large, soft brown eyes; and she was
wondering what her character was, when suddenly a
lady, who had been staking extremely high, rose
from her seat, flinging down her cards, cursing and
swearing in most voluble French.  This was the
first time that Celia had heard a woman use such
language, and she hid her face, shuddering.
</p>

<p>
"Ruined!" said Philip, coolly.  "You had
better come away."
</p>

<p>
The ladies and gentlemen at the card-table set
up a shrill chorus of laughter.
</p>

<p>
"O Philip, take me home!" sobbed Celia.  "I
cannot bear this!"
</p>

<p>
She had heard Squire Passmore swear before
now, but it was generally when he was excited or
angry, and was commonly accompanied by a gentle
"Hush, John!" from his wife.  Philip led his sister
out of the room to the seats in the recess of the
corridor window.
</p>

<p>
"Sit down here a minute," he said, "and recover
yourself, before I take you up-stairs.  That was an
unfortunate accident.  If I had known I should
not have brought you here."
</p>

<p>
"O Philip, let me go home!  No more visits
like this, please!"
</p>

<p>
"You shall do as you like, my dear," said Philip,
kindly; "but the next visit will be very
different from this."
</p>

<p>
Celia rose, trying to compose herself; and, afraid
of disappointing her brother, she consented to be
taken where he wished.
</p>

<p>
"Does Madame de Maintenon receive this afternoon?"
was Philip's question to the usher upstairs.
</p>

<p>
"She does, Sir; and His Royal Highness the
Duke of Bretagne is with her."
</p>

<p>
"Oh, I don't want to see anybody who will
swear!" said Celia, drawing back.
</p>

<p>
"If the Duke of Bretagne have learned to swear,"
answered Philip, gravely, "he must be a marvel of
juvenile depravity; for he will not be three years
old until next February."
</p>

<p>
"A child!" said Celia.  "I beg the little thing's
pardon; I have no objection to that."
</p>

<p>
"The future King of France, my dear," said
Philip.  "He will be Louis XV. (if he live) in a
few years, at the utmost.  Now, three low
courtesies for Madame de Maintenon."
</p>

<p>
In a quiet, pleasant chamber, hung with dark
blue, an old lady sat showing a picture-book to a
very little boy who stood leaning against her knee.
She did not look her age, which was seventy-eight.
Her figure was rather inclining to be tall, and she
preserved the taste, the grace, and the dignity
which had always characterized her.  A complexion
of extreme fairness was relieved by black eyes,
very large and radiant, but the once chestnut hair
now required no powder to make it white.
</p>

<p>
"Mr. Philip Ingram?" she said, with a peculiarly
pleasant smile; "I am very much pleased to
see you."
</p>

<p>
"My sister, Madame," said Philip, as he presented Celia.
</p>

<p>
"I did not know that you had a sister," she answered,
receiving Celia very kindly.  "Louis, will
you give your hand to this lady?"
</p>

<p>
The pretty little child[<a id="chap09fn29text"></a><a href="#chap09fn29">29</a>] addressed trotted
forward, and looking straight in Celia's face with his
great brown eyes, presented his baby hand to be
kissed.  Resisting a strong inclination to take him
on her knee and kiss him, Celia performed her
homage to the future Sovereign.  With much gravity
the little Duke offered the same privilege to
Philip, and trotted back to his picture-book.
</p>

<p>
"My Lady Ingram is not with you?" asked the
old lady.
</p>

<p>
"In the Duchess de Berry's saloon at lansquenet,
Madame."
</p>

<p>
"Ah!  Do you play, Mademoiselle?"
</p>

<p>
"No, Madame," said Celia.
</p>

<p>
"I am glad to hear it," replied Madame de
Maintenon.[<a id="chap09fn30text"></a><a href="#chap09fn30">30</a>]  "It is a great waste of time and
temper, which were not given us for such uses."
</p>

<p>
"Turn over!" required the little Prince,
authoritatively.
</p>

<p>
Madame de Maintenon smiled and obeyed.
</p>

<p>
"I hope His Majesty is not ill?" asked Philip.
"I hear he does not receive."
</p>

<p>
"Not ill, but not well.  One of his troublesome
headaches.  Neither men nor women live forever,
Mr. Ingram&mdash;not even Kings."
</p>

<p>
"True, but unfortunate, Madame," was the civil
answer with which Philip took his leave.
</p>

<p>
"Now we will go home," said he.  "A short
visit, but I thought we had better not interrupt
the Duke's reading-lesson.  Did you like this scene
better than the other?"
</p>

<p>
"O Philip, how different!  Is that lady his
nurse?"
</p>

<p>
"Well, not precisely, my dear.  She is&mdash;only
that she is not called so&mdash;the Queen."
</p>

<p>
"The Queen of France?" asked Celia, opening
her eyes.
</p>

<p>
"The King of France's wife, which I suppose is
the same thing; only that in Madame de Maintenon's
case it is not the same thing.  There is a
paradox!  A strange life that woman has led.
She was born in a prison, the daughter of a
Huguenot father and a Catholic mother; imbibed her
father's teaching, and when young was a determined
little Huguenot.  Her father died early.  Her
mother took her to church, and she turned her
back on the altar.  Madam d'Aubigné slapped
Miss Fanny and turned her round; but Fanny
only presented the other cheek.  'Strike away!'
said she; ''tis a blessed thing to suffer for one's
religion!'  Her mother now thought there was nothing
to be done with the obstinate little heretic,
and gave her up.  Next, the house was burnt&mdash;fortunately
while they were out of it; but for days
Fanny cried inconsolably.  Her mother, who
appears to have been a practical, matter-of-fact
woman, when this sort of thing had gone on for
several days, thought it desirable to treat Miss Fanny
to a slight scolding.  'What a little goose you
are!' she said, 'crying everlastingly for a
house!'  'Oh! it isn't the house!' sobbed Fanny; 'it isn't
the house&mdash;it is dolly!'  Well, Madame d'Aubigné
died while Fanny was still a girl, and she was left
entirely destitute.  In these circumstances she
married, for a home, the ugliest man in France.  He
was a comic poet, a poor deformed fellow, of the
name of Scarron.  Fanny did not gain much by
her marriage, for they were very poor; but her
taste in dress was so exquisite that I have heard
ladies say she looked better in a common gown of
lavender cotton than half the Court ladies in their
silks and satins: and her conversation was so
fascinating that clever men used to dine with Scarron
just for the sake of hearing her talk.
</p>

<p>
"There is a story told of one such dinner, at
which the servant whispered in Madame's ear,
'Please to tell another story; there is not enough
roast beef.'  I have heard these and many other
anecdotes about her from Aunt Sophie, whose
mother-in-law knew her well for many years.
When her husband died, she was again thrown on
the world; and for some time she petitioned the
King in vain for some little property or pension to
which she was entitled us Scarron's widow.  At
last he became perfectly tired of her petitions;
but he had never seen her.  'Widow Scarron!'
His Majesty used to say, as he took up another
petition: 'am I always to be pestered with Widow
Scarron?'  A short time afterwards he met her
somewhere; and her grace, beauty, and wit made
such an impression upon him that he gave her the
appointment of governess to a <i>posse</i> of his children.
When he came to see them, he saw her; and
'Widow Scarron' so grew in his esteem, that it is
supposed about two years after the death of his
Queen, he married her."[<a id="chap09fn31text"></a><a href="#chap09fn31">31</a>]
</p>

<p>
"And why do they call her Madame de Maintenon?"
</p>

<p>
"His Majesty gave her the estate of Maintenon,
and wished her to bear the name."
</p>

<p>
"And what will become of her when he dies?"
</p>

<p>
"Ah, that is just the point!  I should think she
will go into a convent."
</p>

<p>
"I thought you said she was a Huguenot?"
</p>

<p>
"So she was, but she is generally supposed to
be a Catholic now."
</p>

<p>
"What a pity!" said Celia, thoughtfully.  "How
much good she might have done in turning the
King's heart towards the Huguenots, if God had
permitted her!"
</p>

<p>
"On the contrary, she is thought to have turned
him from them.  Many persons say that we may
thank her for the revocation of the Edict of Nantes."
</p>

<p>
"I can scarce believe that, Philip!"
</p>

<p>
"I hardly do myself."
</p>

<p>
"Do you think, Philip," asked Celia, slowly,
after a pause, "that there is one really good man
or woman among all your acquaintance?"
</p>

<p>
"My dear," replied Philip, in his gravest
manner, "I have met with so many good men and
women that I have lost all faith in the article.  I
have seen excellent mothers whose children have
died from neglect, excellent husbands who have
run away with other people's wives, excellent sons
and daughters who have left a kind mother alone in
her old age, and excellent friends who have ruined
their friends' reputations by backbiting.  Never a
one of your good men and women for me, if you
please.  We are all a bad lot together&mdash;that is the
truth; and the best of us is only a trifle less bad
than the others."
</p>

<p>
"But, Philip, do you really know none who has
the fear of God in his heart?"
</p>

<p>
"Yes, I know three people who have it&mdash;you,
and Ned, and Patient.  I cannot name a fourth."
</p>

<p>
"O Philip!  I wish you were the fourth
yourself!" sighed Celia.
</p>

<p>
"So do I, my dear," said Philip, so gravely that
Celia looked up into his face to see what he
meant.  She was perplexed, and scarcely satisfied
with what she read there.
</p>

<p>
"Philip," she asked, dropping her eyes again,
"do <i>you</i> play at these card-tables?"
</p>

<p>
"Never.  I believe Patient thinks I do, but she
is mistaken.  I threw at basset once, and I shall
never do it again."
</p>

<p>
"Did you lose?"
</p>

<p>
"No, I won."
</p>

<p>
"Then what made you determine not to do it again?"
</p>

<p>
"A remark of Leroy, who was standing near.
He said, 'No man ever loses at the first throw.  I
never saw one lose.  The Devil is too cunning for
that.'  I thought that if the habitual frequenters
of the basset-table acknowledged that gentleman
for their president, the less I saw of it the better."
</p>

<p>
"I think you were very wise, Philip," said Celia.
"Monsieur Leroy!  The man who"&mdash;she stopped
suddenly, wondering whether Philip were acquainted
with the facts of which she was thinking.
</p>

<p>
"'The man who'&mdash;precisely: Savarie Leroy.
I see Patient has told you that sad story."
</p>

<p>
"Philip," said Celia, very seriously, "I wish I
could do something to help you.  If you do <i>really</i>
wish to fear God"&mdash;
</p>

<p>
"My dear little sister," replied Philip, putting
his arm round her, "have you any idea how much
you have helped me already?  I am not quite the
Gallio you and Patient think me&mdash;caring for none
of these things.  Now I will just give you a
glimpse into my heart.  I always knew what
Patient was&mdash;she never concealed her thoughts on
the matter; but there are thirty years between her
and me, and I fancied&mdash;perhaps foolishly&mdash;that the
religion which might be very good for her would not
do for me.  I thought many a time, 'If I could find
some one in my own rank, and near my own age,
who had not been brought up with Patient as
Ned and I have, and therefore had not taken
the tone of his feelings from her; if this person
should think, feel, and talk in the same way that she
does, having derived it from a different locality
and breeding, and all that,&mdash;why, then, I should
feel that, whatever else this religion of hers were,
at least it was a reality.'  Now this I never could
have found in Ned, for two reasons: as to religious
breeding, Patient has brought him up; the tone
and color of his religion he derives from her.  And,
secondly, Ned is rather close.  Not in the least
sternly or unkindly so&mdash;nothing of the sort; but he
is not such an open, foolish, off-handed fellow as I
am.  It is not natural to him, as it is to me, to say
everything he thinks, to everybody who comes in
his way; and in religious matters particularly,
what he thinks and feels he keeps to himself.
Well, then you came.  For the first few weeks that
you were here, I watched you like a cat watches a
mouse.  If you had made one slip&mdash;if I had once
seen your profession and practice at variance&mdash;if
you had been less gentle and obedient to my
mother, when I could see that she was making you
do things which you would much rather not do:
or if, on the other hand, you had allowed her to
lead you into something which I knew that you
considered positively forbidden&mdash;if I had seen
anything of this, Celia, I should have gone away
more irretrievably disgusted than ever with
religion and all who professed it.
</p>

<p>
"Now, my dear, I don't want to make you
proud and puff you up, but as I am telling you all
this, I must add that I found not one slip in you.
I cannot understand how you have done it.  It
seems to me that you must have a very large
amount of what Patient calls 'grace,' that I, who
have been watching you so narrowly, could detect
nothing in you which I thought wrong.  Now will
you forgive me for the ordeal through which,
unknown to you, I have been putting you?  The
conclusion to which it has led me is this:&mdash;This
thing&mdash;this religion of yours and Patient's&mdash;call it
fear of God, or what you will&mdash;is a real thing.  It
is not the disordered fancy of one good woman, as
I for a time imagined that it might be.  It is a
genuine compact and converse between God and
your souls, and I only wish I were one of you."
</p>

<p>
Rather to Philip's surprise, Celia, who while he
spoke had been earnestly regarding him, with
brilliant eyes and smiling lips, put her head down
and burst into tears.
</p>

<p>
"My dear!" he said.
</p>

<p>
"O Philip, I am so glad!" she said,&mdash;"so glad,
so thankful&mdash;so very, very glad!"  And she sobbed
for pure joy.
</p>

<p>
"Then I am very glad that I have told you, my
dear.  And if it gives you any satisfaction, I will
say again what I have said:&mdash;from my soul I wish
I were one of you!"
</p>

one point.  In her day ladies' orthography was in a dreadful
state.  Queen Anne usually signed herself the "affectionat
freind" of her correspondents; and it had only just ceased to
be the fashion for ladies to employ the longest words they
could pick up, using them in an incorrect sense, and with a
wrong pronunciation.  Addison gives an account of one French
lady who having unfortunately pronounced a hard word correctly,
and employed it in the proper sense, "all the ladies in the
Court were out of countenance for her."

<p>
"Look out for rocks, Madam Celia," was
Patient's enigmatical comment when she
heard what Philip had said.
</p>

<p>
"I do not understand you, Patient."
</p>

<p>
"Madam, there is nothing harder in this world
than humility, because there is nothing so near to
the Lord.  There are but two places wherein He
dwelleth&mdash;the high and holy Heaven, and the
humble and contrite heart.  Paul, you mind, was
sent a thorn in the flesh because of the abundance
of the revelations.  I have near always found that
when I have had some work to do for the Lord
which was like to make me think well of myself,
there has either been a thorn in the flesh or a
thorn in the spirit sent to me, either just before or
just after.  Most commonly just before.  And it
does not need abundance of revelations, neither,
to set up poor fools like us.  Anything can do
that.  If we are trying to walk close to the Lord,
and give no occasion for stumbling, the Devil can
make pedestals of our very graces whereon to stick
us up and cause us to fall down and worship
ourselves.  Ay, of our very sins he can!  Many's the
time when I have been set up in the forenoon on
account of some very thing which, when I was
calmer, had to be laid open and repented of before
the Lord at night.  Depend upon it, Jonah was
no feeling over lowly when he thought he did well
to be angry.[<a id="chap10fn1text"></a><a href="#chap10fn1">1</a>]  And then, when a little breeze of
repentance does stir the heavy waves of the soul,
the Devil whispers, 'How good, how humble, how
godly you are!'  Ah, 'his devices!'  Thank God
'we are not ignorant' of them.[<a id="chap10fn2text"></a><a href="#chap10fn2">2</a>]  Look out for
rocks, Madam.  I am no true prophet if you find
not a keen wind soon after this."
</p>

<p>
"Tell me, Patient, does my brother Edward fear
God?"
</p>

<p>
"Yes, Madam."
</p>

<p>
"You know he does?"
</p>

<p>
"I have no anxiety about Sir Edward, Madam.
I only wish I were half as sure of Mr. Philip."
</p>

<p>
"Do you think?"&mdash;
</p>

<p>
"Madam, the way is rough and the gate strait,
and 'few there be that find it.'[<a id="chap10fn3text"></a><a href="#chap10fn3">3</a>]  And I don't think
Mr. Philip likes rough walking.  But the Lord
kens that too.  If he have been given to Christ
of the Father, he'll have to come&mdash;'shall come to
Me'[<a id="chap10fn4text"></a><a href="#chap10fn4">4</a>]&mdash;and he'll find no more to greet over than
the rest of the children when we all get Home to
the Father's House.  'Neither shall any man
pluck them out of My hand.'"[<a id="chap10fn5text"></a><a href="#chap10fn5">5</a>]
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
Lady Ingram did not return from the Palace
before eight o'clock in the evening, and then in an
exceedingly bad temper.  Fashionably so, only;
she was much too accomplished and polished to
go into a vulgar passion.  Thérèse discovered the
state of her mistress's mind when she found that
she could do nothing to please her.  The new
dress, of which Lady Ingram had expressed her
full approbation in the morning, was declared
"<i>effroyante</i>" at night; and Thérèse had to alter
the style of her lady's hair five times before she
condescended to acknowledge herself satisfied.
At length she appeared in her boudoir, and after
breakfast, instead of paying her usual visit to
Celia's room, sent a message desiring Celia to
come to her.
</p>

<p>
"Are you not well, Madam?" was Celia's natural
query, when she saw how pale and heavy-eyed
Lady Ingram looked.
</p>

<p>
"Well! yes, my dear; but I have scarcely slept.
I left fifteen hundred pounds behind me at that
horrible lansquenet."
</p>

<p>
Celia's eyes opened rather wide.  The sum
indicated was almost incredible to her simple
apprehension.
</p>

<p>
"My dear," said Lady Ingram, pettishly, "you
are still only half-formed.  Do not open your eyes
in that way&mdash;it makes you look astonished.  A
woman of the world never wonders."
</p>

<p>
"I am not a woman of the world, Madam."
</p>

<p>
"Then my lessons have been of very little use to
you.  I am afraid you are not, really, and never
will be.  That reminds me of what I wished to say
to you.  I am informed by some one who saw you,
that after you and Philip left me in the saloon of
the Duchess, he took you into the great drawing-room,
and that at something you saw there you
burst into tears.  Now really, my dear, this is
totally inadmissible.  You scandalized those who
saw you.  Had you heard some dreadful news, or
some such thing, it might have been proper and
even laudable to shed a few tears; but actually to
sob, in the sight of all the world, just as any
laundress or orange-girl might have done,&mdash;really, Celia,
you must get over this weakness!"
</p>

<p>
"I beg your pardon, Madam," replied Celia,
timidly, "but really I could not help it.  There
was a lady at the card-table who had lost a great
deal&mdash;at least Philip thought so&mdash;and she began
speaking such horrible words that it terrified me;
I could not help it."
</p>

<p>
"'Could not help it!'" repeated Lady Ingram,
contemptuously.  "Cannot you help anything you
choose?  Oh, yes! it was the Countess des
Ferrières,&mdash;she had lost £30,000 and her estates,
every livre she had, even to the earrings which she
wore, so of course she was ruined.  But you quite
mistake, my dear&mdash;you need not have felt terrified.
You are in error if you suppose that swearing is
interdicted to men, and even women, of quality.[<a id="chap10fn6text"></a><a href="#chap10fn6">6</a>]  Quite
the contrary, it is rather modish than otherwise.
A few gentle oaths, such as"&mdash;(and Lady
Ingram gave a short list)&mdash;"are quite admissible in
such circumstances.  You would hear them from
the lips of the best families in France.  If it were
not modish, of course it would be highly improper;
but you are entirely mistaken if you suppose it so.
Any of those I have mentioned would be quite
proper&mdash;for you, even.  I have heard much
stronger words than those from the Duchess de
Berry, and she is younger than you are.  But
mercy on us, child! what eyes you make!"
</p>

<p>
They were gleaming like stars.  Lady Ingram a
words had lighted up a fire behind them, and
every feeling of timidity was burnt up in the blaze
of its indignation.
</p>

<p>
"My Lady Ingram!" said Celia, with a dignity
in her voice and manner which her step-mother
had never seen her assume, and believed to be
quite foreign to her nature, "I did not come to
Paris either to deny my religion or to outrage my
God.  In all matters which concern Him not, you
have moulded me at your will.  I thought that you
took to me the place of my dead father and mother,
and I have obeyed you as I would have obeyed
them.  But into the sanctuary of my soul you
cannot penetrate; on the threshold of the temple
even you must pause.  God is more to me than
father or mother, and at the risk of your
displeasure&mdash;at the risk of my life if needs be&mdash;I must
obey Him.  'The Lord sitteth upon the flood, yea,
the Lord sitteth King forever;'[<a id="chap10fn7text"></a><a href="#chap10fn7">7</a>] and 'He will not
hold him guiltless that taketh His Name in
vain!'"[<a id="chap10fn8text"></a><a href="#chap10fn8">8</a>]
</p>

<p>
Notwithstanding all Lady Ingram's condemnation
of feelings, she was just now overpowered by her
own.  In the foreground was amazement.  Had
her little pug Venus opened its mouth and emitted
a moral axiom, she could hardly have been more
astonished.  Behind her surprise came annoyance,
amusement, and respect for the strange, new
bravery of Celia; but in the background, beyond
all those, was a very unpleasant and unusual
sensation, which she did not attempt to analyze.
It was, really, the discovery of a character which
she could not fathom, of a strength which she
could not weaken, of a temple into which she could
not enter.  She had always prided herself upon
her ability to read every person's character at a
glance: and here was the especial character which
she had set down as simple, and almost beneath
notice, presenting itself in an aspect which it was
beyond her skill to comprehend.  She had not,
indeed, forgotten Celia's confession at the outset of
their acquaintance; but she had set it down to her
English education, as a past phase of thought
which she had succeeded in dispelling.  A little
more banter on the one hand, and firmness on the
other, would, she thought, rid Celia of her absurd
and obsolete notions.  She had threaded all the
mazes, and she meant her speech just uttered to
be the last turn in the path, the last struggle
between herself and her step-daughter.  And lo! here,
at that last turn, stood a guarded sanctuary,
too strong for her weapons to attack, into which
she knew not the way, of whose services she had
never learned the language.  A strange and
sudden darkness fell over her spirit.  There was a
Power here in opposition to her stronger than her
own.  This simple, docile, untaught girl knew some
strange thing which she did not know.  And with
this conviction came another and a disagreeable
idea.  Might it not be something which it
immediately concerned her to know?  What if Celia were
right&mdash;if all things were not bounded by this life;
if there were another, unknown world beyond this
world, guided by different laws?  What if God
were real, and Heaven were real, and Hell were
real?  if there were a point beyond which prayers
were mockery, and penances were vain?  A veil
was lifted up for a moment which had covered all
this from her; a dark, thick, heavy veil, which all
her life she had been at work to weave.  A voice
from Heaven whispered to her, and it said, "Thou
fool!"  When moments such as these do not soften
and convict, they harden and deaden.  The veil
dropped, and Lady Ingram was herself again&mdash;her
heart more rock than ever.  It was in a
particularly cold, hard voice that she spoke
again.
</p>

<p>
"Celia, if you do not take care, I shall wash my
hands of you.  I will not be braved in this
manner by a mere girl&mdash;a girl whose character is
wholly unformed, and whose breeding is infinitely
below her quality.  Go to your chamber, and
remain there until you are sufficiently humbled to
request my pardon for treating me with so little
respect."
</p>

<p>
"Madam," was the soft answer, "if I have shown
you any disrespect, I will ask your pardon now.
It was not my wish to do so."
</p>

<p>
Ah! the thing which Celia had shown Claude Ingram,
and at which she could not bear to look, was
her own heart.
</p>

<p>
"Will you then retract what you have said?"
</p>

<p>
"If I have said anything personally offensive to
your Ladyship, I will retract it and ask your
forgiveness.  What I have said of my own relation to
God I never can retract, Madam, for it is real and
eternal."
</p>

<p>
Lady Ingram was silent for a moment.  Then
she said, in her hardest voice and coldest manner,
"Go to your chamber."  Celia, courtesying to her
step-mother, retired without another word.  Left
alone in her own boudoir, again that cloud of dread
darkness rolled over Claude Ingram.  The presence
of the accusing angel was withdrawn, but the
accusations rankled yet.  She sat for some time in
silence, and at length rose with a sudden shiver and
a heavy sigh.  Opening with a little silver key a
private closet, richly ornamented, a shrine was
disclosed, where a silver lamp burned before an image
of the Virgin.  Here Lady Ingram knelt, and made
an "Act of Contrition" and an "Act of Faith."[<a id="chap10fn9text"></a><a href="#chap10fn9">9</a>]  The
repetition of vain words put no more contrition
nor faith into her heart than before she uttered
them.  Only the soul was lulled to sleep: and she
rose satisfied with herself and her interview.
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
"Do you think I did wrong, Patient?" asked
Celia, sadly, of her sole <i>confidante</i>, at the moment
when, at the other end of the house, Lady Ingram
was finishing her devotions.
</p>

<p>
Patient replied in a measured and constrained
voice, "'He that loveth father or mother more
than Me is not worthy of Me.'"[<a id="chap10fn10text"></a><a href="#chap10fn10">10</a>]
</p>

<p>
"Yes, I know; but I am so very anxious not to
be wanting in respect to her&mdash;not to put any
obstacles in her way."
</p>

<p>
"The more obstacles in her way the better,
Madam; for it is the broad road that leadeth to
destruction, and many there be which go in
thereat."[<a id="chap10fn11text"></a><a href="#chap10fn11">11</a>]
</p>

<p>
Celia sighed heavily, but made no answer.
</p>

<p>
"Ah, poor blind soul!" continued Patient.  "If
only we would look more at all men and women in
one light, and measure them by one test&mdash;friends
of Christ, or enemies of Christ&mdash;I think we would
behave different from that we do."
</p>

<p>
Patient stitched away without saying more, and
Celia sat looking thoughtfully out of the open
window.  From some cause unknown to herself,
there suddenly rose before her a vision of the
great laurel at Ashcliffe, and the stranger blessing
her in the name of the Virgin.  She exclaimed,
"Patient!" in a tone which would have startled
any one less unimpressionable than the placid
woman who sat opposite her.
</p>

<p>
"Madam!" replied Patient, without any change
of manner.
</p>

<p>
Celia told her the circumstance of which she was
thinking, and added, "Can you guess who it was,
Patient?"
</p>

<p>
"What manner of man was he, Madam?"
</p>

<p>
Celia closed her eyes and tried to recall him.
</p>

<p>
"A tall, thin, comely man, with a brown skin,
and no color on cheeks or lips: dark hair somewhat
unkempt, bright dark eyes, and a very soft,
persuasive tone of voice.  His clothes had been
good, but were then ragged, and he looked as if he
had been ill, or might become so.  I always
wondered if it could be my father; but as he died
when I was but a child, that is not possible."
</p>

<p>
"And what was the day, Madam?"
</p>

<p>
"Some day in November, 1710."
</p>

<p>
"I think I can guess who it was, Madam Celia.
No, it could not have been your father; and
I know but one who answers to that description,
yet I knew not that he had been in England so
late as that.  It was my husband, Gilbert Irvine."
</p>

<p>
"Patient!" exclaimed Celia, interested at once.
"Had he been ill?"
</p>

<p>
"Nay, Madam, 'twas the other way: he fell ill
afterward.  He died about twelve months thereafter."
</p>

<p>
"Poor Patient!"
</p>

<p>
"Do not pity me, Madam.  I had nought but
what I deserved."
</p>

<p>
"I am afraid I should not like to have all
I deserve, Patient.  But what do you mean?"
</p>

<p>
"Madam, do you mind the Israelites under
Joshua, which accepted the Gibeonites because of
their spoiled victuals and clouted shoon, and
asked not counsel at the mouth of the Lord?
That was what I did.  I was a plain, portionless
maid, having nought but my labor, and he was my
Lady's gentleman-usher, in a better place than I,
and a rare hand at talking any one over to what
he had a mind to&mdash;ay, he was that!  And so
I took him because of his comely face and
his flattering tongue, and such like, and asked not
counsel at the mouth of the Lord.  And 'tis mine
experience, Madam, that while the Lord never
faileth to bring good out of evil for His people in
the end, yet that oft for a time, when they be
obstinately bent on taking their own way, He
leaveth them to eat of the fruit of it.  I say
not how 'tis with other believers; but this I know,
that my worst troubles have ever been them
I have pulled on mine own head.  There is
a sort of comfort in a trouble by Divine ordinance,
which it lacks when 'tis only by Divine permission,
and you know you are yourself to blame for
it.  And little comfort I had with Gilbert Irvine.
I've envied Isabel Paterson in the cave with
her guidman&mdash;ay, many and many a time!  And
I have asked the Lord to do more than a miracle
for me&mdash;for to turn Gilbert's heart would have
been on the thither side of a miracle, I'm
thinking,&mdash;more wonderful yet.  You mind, Madam,"
added Patient, suddenly, as if afraid of being
misunderstood on this point, "Gilbert was no
a Papist when I and he were wed.  I should have
seen my way through <i>that</i>, I think, for all the blind
fool that I was; but it was no for five years
thence.  He professed the Evangel then, and went
to the preaching like any Christian.  The Lord
forgive him&mdash;if it be no Papistry to say it: anyhow,
the Lord forgive <i>me</i>!"
</p>

<p>
"There are no miracles, now, certainly," said
Celia, reflectively.  "I can quite fancy what a
comfort it must have been to live in the days of
miracles.  But who was Isabel Paterson, and what
cave did she live in?"
</p>

<p>
"Are there no miracles now, Madam?" asked
Patient.  "Ah, but I'll be long ere I say that!  If
the Lord wrought no miracle for John Paterson&mdash;ay,
and twice over too&mdash;I little ken what a miracle
is.  But truly he was a godly man above many.
'Tis mostly Elijahs that be fed by angels and
ravens, though I'm no saying that, if it pleased the
Lord, He might not work wonders for you and me.
'Tis ill work setting limits to the Lord."
</p>

<p>
"But who was Isabel Paterson, and who was
John Paterson?" urged Celia again.
</p>

<p>
"I'll tell you, Madam.  John Paterson&mdash;he was
Isabel's guidman&mdash;was a small farming-man at
Pennyvenie, but at one time he dwelt for a season
no so far from Lauchie.  'Twas when I was a
young maid that these things happened.  I knew
Isabel Paterson, and many a crack I've had with
her when I was a lassie, and she a thriving young
wife with wee weans about her.  Well, John, her
guidman, was a marked man to King Charles's
troopers, and many a time they set out to hunt
him down.  He could no dwell in his own house,
but was forced to seek sleeping-room on the Crag
of Benbeoch, between two great rocks, only visiting
his own home by stealth.  The first of these
times the dragoons came on him as he was coming
down from Benbeoch to the little white farmhouse
below, and Isabel was watching his coming from
the window.  As he was crossing the moor they
saw him, and he saw them.  John, he turned and
ran, and they galloped after.  He heard them
coming over the moor, and leaping the stone wall that
girdled Benbeoch Crags, and he thought, 'Ah! sure
'tis all over with me now!'  For only that
week had Claverhouse hanged Davie Keith at his
own door, and he was sib to Paterson.  John he
ran, and the troops they galloped: he crying
mightily unto the Lord to save him for His Name's
sake.  And while the words were yet in his mouth,
and the dragoons were so near him that he could
hear their speech to one another, all at once his
feet caught at a stone, and down he fell.  He gave
himself up for lost then, for the horses were right
on him.  'But where am I going?' thinks he.
Through the heather he fell, through the grass,
through the very solid earth aneath him.  Madam,
the Lord made a new thing, and the earth opened
her mouth and swallowed him up, rather than he
should fall into the hands of his enemies.  When
he came to himself&mdash;for he was a bit bruised and
stunned by the fall&mdash;he felt that he was in some
wide dry cavern, many a foot across, and he heard
overhead the troopers cursing and swearing that
they could not find the hole where, quoth they,
the fox had run to earth.  And John down aneath
was kneeling and giving thanks to the Lord, enjoying,
as he told afterwards, the blessedest hour of
communion with Him that ever he had.  After a
while the troopers gave it up as a bad job, and off
they went.  And when John dared to climb up out
of the hole, and pop up his head through the long
grass and heather, there was nought but the green
grass and the purple heather, and God's blue sky
over all.  After a time he ventured forth, and
hearing a wail of a woman's voice, found Isabel
mourning on the hill-side, seeking his dead body,
never doubting that the troopers had slain him.
He helped her into the cave, and there they knelt
down together and praised the Lord again.  And
by degrees, after a while, they carried bedding and
household goods such as could be spared to this
safe shelter which the Lord had provided for them,
and not only John, but others of the brethren, hid
there for many a day after, when Claverhouse was
known to be in the country."
</p>

<p>
"Patient, is that really true?"
</p>

<p>
"True as Gospel, Madam.  I had it from Isabel
her ain sel'."
</p>

<p>
"But the cave must have been there before,
surely."
</p>

<p>
"Maybe, Madam, or maybe not," said Patient,
a little obstinately.  "We ken little of what goes
on in the heart of the earth.  Anyhow, it had
never been found before, though there were
shepherds who knew every inch of Benbeoch Crags:
and there it was ready when John Paterson fell in
need of it."
</p>

<p>
"And what was his second escape, Patient?"
</p>

<p>
"That, Madam, was well-nigh as strange, for
the Lord made choice of a poor silly beast as his
deliverer.  'Twas indeed the earlier deliverance of
the two.  It began just like to the other:&mdash;John
was running over the moor afore Claverhouse's
troops, a meeting in the Black Glen having been
broke up on the rumor of their coming.  But this
time the men had dogs with them.  John, he ran
as long as he could over Longstone Moss, calling
on the Lord for deliverance as he ran.  All the
way across the bog he kept pace with them, for
the horses being heavier, and the troopers armed,
they had ill work to get on through the bog.  But
he, knowing that the Moss once passed, they
would be far swifter than he on the hard ground,
looked around earnestly for some safe hiding-place.
Coming upon a deep furrow of moss and
long grass running across the bog, he lay down in
it, scarce hoping that it could be enough to hide
him, but for just what men call a chance.  Hitherto
he had seen only the troopers, and had not noticed
the dogs; but all at once, as he lay in this long
grass, he heard their deep bay come across the
moor.  'That sound,' quoth he, 'struck upon my
heart like a death-knell.  That sense of smell
which God had given them was sure and unerring;
and these men were now using it to hunt God's
children to the death.'  Straight and sure came
the hounds rushing upon him.  He cried once
more unto the Lord, and then was about to rise
lest the dogs should tear him.  When, all at once,
he heard among the long grass at his head a
whirring sound, and a fox dashed close past him.
Ay, but that was a scurry!  Horses, dogs, and
men, away they set after the fox, and they never
came back that day.[<a id="chap10fn12text"></a><a href="#chap10fn12">12</a>]  So again the Lord delivered
him."
</p>

<p>
"But you don't think, Patient, that He made
the fox on purpose?"
</p>

<p>
"Madam," said Patient, a little dryly, "I am
not in the Lord's counsels.  I should fancy that
He guided a common fox to do the thing; but I
cannot presume to say that the bit beastie was
not created there and then.  We are too apt to
limit the Lord, Madam."
</p>

<p>
"But God has given over creating, Patient."
</p>

<p>
"Has He so, Madam?" asked Patient, dubiously.
"Is it no new creation when the buds
spring forth, when the grass groweth up, and 'He
reneweth the face of the earth'?[<a id="chap10fn13text"></a><a href="#chap10fn13">13</a>]  'God did rest
the seventh day from all His works;'[<a id="chap10fn14text"></a><a href="#chap10fn14">14</a>] but the
Scripture doth not tell us what He did on the
eighth.  Moreover, saith our Lord that 'the
Father worketh.'[<a id="chap10fn15text"></a><a href="#chap10fn15">15</a>]  This I know&mdash;that if the
purpose of the Lord were to preserve John Paterson
by means of a fox, that fox should sooner have
been brought from the Indies as on dry land than
that His purpose should fail.  'He will work, and
who shall let it?'"[<a id="chap10fn16text"></a><a href="#chap10fn16">16</a>]
</p>

<p>
"I say!" observed Mr. Philip Ingram at the
door, "what have you been doing, or saying, or
something, to my mother?  I have not seen her
in such a state I don't know when."
</p>

<p>
"I am afraid I have displeased her," said Celia,
"but I could not help it.  If I had it to do over
again, I must say just the same thing in substance."
</p>

<p>
"Have you been running a tilt with her, my
pugnacious warrior?" asked Philip, glancing at
his reflection in the mirror.
</p>

<p>
"Something like it, I am afraid."
</p>

<p>
"Ah!  I thought as much when I was desired,
just now, to talk upon some subject more
agreeable than you.  I said I did not know any, and
departed; doubly willing to do so as I found that
she had the megrims."
</p>

<p>
"I thought she looked poorly," said Celia,
compassionately.
</p>

<p>
Philip indulged in a peal of laughter.
</p>

<p>
"My sweet rustic innocence!  I thought I told
you that megrims stood for Père Letellier.  He is
closeted with her Ladyship, assisting her to mourn
over your lamentable departure from the faith and
the mode.  I should not very much wonder if you
were treated to a visit from his reverence."
</p>

<p>
"Oh dear!" said Celia, involuntarily.
</p>

<p>
"He isn't such a formidable being," said Philip.
"He used to confess me when I was about the
height of that table, and order me a certain
quantity of sugar-plums for penance&mdash;I know it was
two for squalling, and four for stamping and
kicking.  I lost my temper with tolerable frequency
under that discipline."
</p>

<p>
Patient sighed and shook her head slowly.
</p>

<p>
"Now how much wisdom lies in a shake of
some people's heads!  Patient, my dear creature,
you could not have conveyed your meaning half
so well in words."
</p>

<p>
"I am doubtful if you know my meaning, Mr. Philip."
</p>

<p>
"Know your meaning!  Why, it was written on
your head in that shake!  Did it not say, 'Philip
Ingram! your education was awfully bad, and you
are what might be expected from it'?"
</p>

<p>
"Nay, Sir, scarce that.  I was thinking rather
of that word, 'I am against the shepherds,'[<a id="chap10fn17text"></a><a href="#chap10fn17">17</a>] and
yet more of that other word of John, 'Therefore
shall her plagues come in one day, ... for strong
is the Lord God who judgeth her.'"[<a id="chap10fn18text"></a><a href="#chap10fn18">18</a>]
</p>

<p>
"Spare me, please!" exclaimed Philip, springing
up.  "You never quote from the Revelation without
a sermon after it.  Urgent business requires
my presence down-stairs.  Mrs. Celia Ingram, your
servant!"
</p>

<p>
And he shut the door, laughing; but the next
minute he opened it again to say, "If Père
Letellier should take it into his head to come here,
send for me to keep you in countenance.  You will
find the bear in its den&mdash;Patient knows where."
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
"But, Philip, what do you expect people to do?"
</p>

<p>
It was not the advent of Père Letellier, but his
own want of occupation, which, to use Philip's
elegant simile, had drawn the bear out of its den.
Père Letellier was gone some hours before, and
Lady Ingram had shut herself up, desiring Thérèse
to tell any one who asked for her that she had the
vapors, and could see nobody; and Philip, thus
thrown back on his own society or his sister's, had
selected the latter as the pleasanter of the two.
</p>

<p>
"But what do you expect people to do?" was
Celia's natural reply to Philip's remark that good
people never did anything.
</p>

<p>
"Well, my dear, I can only say that if I were
one of you good folks, I could not live as you do.
If I believed&mdash;really, honestly believed&mdash;that all
the people, or not all, say one-half, say one-tenth
of the people around me, in this city alone, were
going to perdition as fast as they could travel, and
that I knew of something which would save them,
if I could only persuade them to take it,&mdash;why,
my dear Celia, I could never sit quietly on this
sofa!  I should want to go out instantly 'into the
highways and hedges, and compel them to come
in.'[<a id="chap10fn19text"></a><a href="#chap10fn19">19</a>]  It would be as cruel as helping oneself to
an extra slice of plumcake in the presence of a
starving wretch who had lived for a week on a
handful of potato-parings."
</p>

<p>
"Philip, I am sure you have been reading the
Bible.  You have quoted it several times lately."
</p>

<p>
"I told you I had read it," answered Philip,
shortly.
</p>

<p>
"Mr. Philip," said Patient, very gravely, "you
have given me somewhat to meditate upon.  Your
words are very exercising.  We do scarce follow
sufficiently that word, 'Consider your ways.'[<a id="chap10fn20text"></a><a href="#chap10fn20">20</a>]  You
are quite right, Sir, more shame for us!"
</p>

<p>
"Very well, then, you agree with me," said
Philip.  "Well, and here are all the good,
charitably-disposed Catholics shutting themselves up in
convents and telling their beads; and all the good,
charitably-disposed Protestants sitting on sofas,
reading their good books, and mourning to each
other over the wickedness of the world.  Now, is
that really the best thing that either party can
find to do?"
</p>

<p>
"Mr. Philip, I hope you don't mean to go to
compare the poor blind souls of Papists, worshipping
idols in those wicked monasteries, with
enlightened Christian believers either in Scotland
or England?" objected Patient, with a shade of
rising indignation in her tone.
</p>

<p>
"I do not mean to say that the 'believers,' as
you call them, may not be doing more good to
their own souls than the monks and nuns: but if
they sit still on their sofas, what more good are
they doing the world than the monks are?  Is it
not the same thing under another name?  Are
they helping to lessen by one grain the heap of
wickedness they mourn over?"
</p>

<p>
"I am afraid you are right, Philip," said Celia,
thoughtfully.
</p>

<p>
"That is just the failing of you good folks,"
resumed he.  "You hear of a poor family, shockingly
destitute, and steeped in all manner of sin
and wickedness; and you say to each other, 'Isn't
it dreadful?'  You talk them over&mdash;perhaps you
pray them over; but at the best, you do anything
but put on your hat and go and try to lift them
out of the mire.  Oh dear no!  They are far too
dirty and disagreeable for your delicate fingers.
I am without, as you know; and on the principle
that 'lookers-on see most of the game,' those
things show more plainly to us than to you.  Look
at the men in our prisons.  They are beyond you
now.  But was there no time when they were not
beyond you?  Did they pass, do you think, in five
minutes from little children saying the Paternoster
at their mother's knee, to the hardened criminals
to whom you would not dare to speak?  You
should talk to Colville.  He would put everything
before you far better than I can."
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
A few days after this conversation, Celia made
the acquaintance of her brother's solitary friend.
Lady Ingram's reception took place on the
Thursday subsequent; and that lady, who had not
yet resumed her usual graciousness to Celia,
nevertheless intimated her pleasure that her
step-daughter should be present.  As Celia sat quietly
in her corner, moralizing to herself on the scene,
Philip's voice beside her said&mdash;
</p>

<p>
"Celia, my dear, allow me to introduce you.
Mr. Colville, Mrs. Ingram.  Mrs. Ingram,
Mr. Colville."
</p>

<p>
Celia lifted her eyes with much curiosity.  Her
first impression was that Philip's friend was a very
thin long man, with very light hair and eyes of the
palest blue, a stoop in the shoulders, and a
noticeable nose.  He and Philip remained standing
by her chair.
</p>

<p>
"An interesting scene this," observed Mr. Colville,
in a deep, hollow voice.  "Pleasant to
see men and women enjoying themselves.  Life is
short, and death certain.  Let us be happy while
we can."
</p>

<p>
"After death the judgment.'"[<a id="chap10fn21text"></a><a href="#chap10fn21">21</a>]  The words
came suddenly from Celia's lips, and almost
without her volition.
</p>

<p>
Mr. Colville smiled condescendingly.
</p>

<p>
"You are one of the old-fashioned thinkers," he
said.  "I shall be happy to show you how mistaken
such a notion is.  I always take a pleasure
in disabusing young minds."
</p>

<p>
"Very generous of you," said Philip&mdash;Celia
was not sure whether seriously or ironically.
</p>

<p>
"'Mistaken!'" she exclaimed, lifting her clear
eyes to her opponent's, and thinking that her
ears must have made some strange mistake.
"'Tis a passage of Scripture."
</p>

<p>
"A fable, Madam," returned Mr. Colville,
coolly.  "Quite inconsistent with the character
of God, who is a perfect Being; and most injurious
to the minds of men.  The soul, I assure you,
is a mere quality of the body; it has no substance,
yet is entirely material, and perishes with the
body of which it is a quality."
</p>

<p>
"Sir, how can God's revelation be a fable?"
was Celia's very grave reply.  "And, without
that revelation, what can we know of the
character of God?"
</p>

<p>
"My dear Madam," replied Mr. Colville, with
his pitying, patronizing smile, "these are quite
obsolete, disproved notions.  There can be no
such thing as revelation; 'tis impossible.  And
there are no means of any kind by which man can
understand the character of God.  We know from
nature that God is infinitely powerful, and
infinitely wise.  Of His moral character we can have
no idea, except that He is a perfect Being.
Whatever, therefore, is inconsistent with
perfection, is inconsistent with God."
</p>

<p>
"Inconsistent with your notions of perfection,
you mean," said Philip.  "Doesn't it require a
perfect creature to imagine perfection?"
</p>

<p>
"Then," pursued Mr. Colville, taking no notice
of Philip, "you suppose that all Scripture is of
Divine original.  This is another mistake.  The
Gospel is of Divine original, and perhaps some
portions of the Old Testament; but the
Pentateuch was compiled by a most ignorant and
unphilosophical man, a repellent, sanguinary
law-giver&mdash;and the Epistles are the product of heated
brains.  Paul was a cabalistic Rabbi, a delirious
enthusiast; Peter, a poor ignorant fisherman.[<a id="chap10fn22text"></a><a href="#chap10fn22">22</a>]  What
could you expect from such persons?
Entirely human, Madam, these parts of Scripture!"
</p>

<p>
"And you, Mr. Colville," said Celia, warmly,
"dare to sit thus in judgment upon God!  You
presume to lay your human hand on different
portions of His Book, and to say, 'This is from
God, and this is from man!'  Sir, at His bar you
must one day stand, and by that Book you will
have to be judged."
</p>

<p>
"Believe me, I quite honor your warmth and
kindly feelings.  Youth is enthusiastical&mdash;given
to hero-worship.  'Tis a pity to set up for your
hero a mere dead book.  But perhaps you
misunderstand me.  I do not reject all Scripture.
For the words and character of Jesus I have
great respect.  He was unquestionably a true
philanthropist, and an enlightened man&mdash;a very
excellent man.  But"&mdash;
</p>

<p>
Celia had risen and stood before him.  She
forgot all about the lighted rooms and the crowds
who might be watching and listening.  "And no
more?" she said, in a voice of suppressed intensity.
</p>

<p>
"More?" answered Mr. Colville.  "What could
you wish me to say more?"
</p>

<p>
"Mr. Colville, your words, complimentary as
they might be if you were speaking of a man, are
but an insult&mdash;an insult to Him in whom is life,[<a id="chap10fn23text"></a><a href="#chap10fn23">23</a>]
and who is the brightness of the Father's
glory.[<a id="chap10fn24text"></a><a href="#chap10fn24">24</a>]  I cannot bear them!"
</p>

<p>
She would have passed on, but Colville detained
her.
</p>

<p>
"My dear Madam, you entirely mistake.  Suffer
me but to show you"&mdash;
</p>

<p>
"Sir, I shall speak with you no more.  'He
that biddeth you God-speed is the partaker of
your evil deeds.'"[<a id="chap10fn25text"></a><a href="#chap10fn25">25</a>]
</p>

<p>
And Celia made her way through the rooms and
gained her own boudoir without another word to
any one.  But she had not been there for five
minutes before Philip followed her.
</p>

<p>
"Upon my word, Celia!" said he, laughing, "I
had no idea what an amount of undeveloped
soldiery there was under that quiet manner of yours.
You have fairly rendered Colville speechless&mdash;a
state of things I never saw before.  I beg to
congratulate the successful general on the victory!"
</p>

<p>
"Philip, how can you like that odious man?"
</p>

<p>
"Well, my dear," responded Philip, "I am
beginning rather to wonder at it myself.  He has
become insipid latterly.  I used to think him a
very ingenious fellow; I am beginning to suspect
that he is only a showy donkey!"
</p>

<p>
"He is an Atheist," said Celia, in a tone of
horror.
</p>

<p>
"Scarce that, my dear," answered Philip,
quietly.  "He does believe in a sort of God, but
'tis one of his own making."
</p>

<p>
"Will that deliver him in the day of the Lord's
wrath?"[<a id="chap10fn26text"></a><a href="#chap10fn26">26</a>] asked Celia in a low tone.  "Philip, I
hope I said nothing wrong.  I did not mean to
speak uncourteously or unchristianly.  I hope I
did not do it."
</p>

<p>
"My dear little scrap of scrupulousness!  Do
you suppose that a soldier in the heat of battle
says 'Pray excuse me!' to the opposite man
before he fires at him?"
</p>

<p>
"Ah! but the weapons of my warfare ought
not to have been carnal.[<a id="chap10fn27text"></a><a href="#chap10fn27">27</a>]  St. Paul says, 'Speaking
the truth in love.'[<a id="chap10fn28text"></a><a href="#chap10fn28">28</a>]  I am afraid there was not
much love in what I said to-night."
</p>

<p>
"No, dear Celia, the truth was so hot that it
burnt it up," said Philip, laughing.  "Don't make
yourself miserable.  Colville will hardly break his
heart over it.  Indeed, I am not certain that he
keeps one.  Are you not coming down again?
Well, then, good-night."
</p>

<p>
On questioning her counsellor Patient in a
similar manner, Celia found her unable to see any
error in her act.  Perhaps the old fiery Covenanter
spirit was too strong in her to temper the
words which she spoke.  That which to Celia was
merely carrying out the apostolic injunction, "Be
courteous,"[<a id="chap10fn29text"></a><a href="#chap10fn29">29</a>] was in Patient's eyes "conferring
with flesh and blood."[<a id="chap10fn30text"></a><a href="#chap10fn30">30</a>]
</p>

<p>
"Nay, Madam," said she, "if Paul himself
could say, 'If any man preach any other Gospel
unto you than that ye have received, let him be
accursed,'[<a id="chap10fn31text"></a><a href="#chap10fn31">31</a>] are we to mince our words and dress
the truth to make it dainty to the world and the
Devil?  Is it not written, 'If any man love not
the Lord Jesus Christ, let him be Anathema
Maran-atha'?"[<a id="chap10fn32text"></a><a href="#chap10fn32">32</a>]
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
"You retired early last night," said Lady Ingram
to Celia, as she sipped her chocolate on the
following afternoon.  "You were tired, I suppose?"
</p>

<p>
"No, Madam," said Celia, honestly; "I was angry."
</p>

<p>
Lady Ingram gave her usual sign of surprise or
perplexity&mdash;a very slight elevation of her chiselled
eyebrows.
</p>

<p>
"With whom, my dear?"
</p>

<p>
"With Mr. Colville, Madam."
</p>

<p>
"A very good family, child," said Lady Ingram,
gravely.  "A younger branch, it is true, but still
an old family&mdash;allied to the Colvilles of
Bassingbourne.  They can trace their descent to the
eleventh century."
</p>

<p>
"Madam, Mr. Colville and I were not disputing
the length of our descent."
</p>

<p>
"When you do, my dear, remember that you are
of a still older family than he.  Hubert de Ingeramme
went over to England with William the Conqueror,
and before that his line had been seated at
Gournay and Ingeramme from the days of Rollo.
You must be careful to remember, child, that if
there be no high titles in your house, you are very
ancient indeed; and that, after all, is the real thing.
There are many families in France who are merely
Counts or Barons in respect of title, but whose
lines are as old as the Crown itself.  '<i>Familles en
velours rouge cramoisi,</i>'[<a id="chap10fn33text"></a><a href="#chap10fn33">33</a>] that is what some call them.
And yours, my dear, is a crimson velvet family.
Pray don't allow any one to dispute that."
</p>

<p>
"I am not in the least likely, Madam," was
Celia's amused reply.
</p>

<p>
"That is right, my child!" resumed Lady Ingram,
condescendingly.  "I am rejoiced to see
that you appreciate the importance of the subject.
By the way, has Philip told you that he has
received a commission from His Majesty?"
</p>

<p>
"Yes, Madam," said Philip's sister, sighing.
</p>

<p>
"My dear," answered his mother, "there is nothing
to sigh about.  'Tis high honor to receive a
commission from King James.  The troops, I learn,
march for Landrécies on the 19th&mdash;next Monday;
and are to oppose Prince Eugene there about the
10th of next month.  I propose, therefore, to travel
to Landrécies, where I shall take apartments&mdash;small
and inconvenient, I fear they will be: but I
suppose you can put up with that?  And then Philip
can come and see us from time to time while the
troops are there; and I shall be able to see that he
powders his hair properly, and does not neglect
the tying of his cravats.  'Twould never do that an
Ingram should be unmodish, even in battle.  Only
think, if he were to go into action in a Steenkirk![<a id="chap10fn34text"></a><a href="#chap10fn34">34</a>]  I
should never forgive myself.  And he is far too
careless in that respect."
</p>

<p>
"I can put up with anything that you can, Madam,"
said Celia, answering only one clause of her
step-mother's speech.
</p>

<p>
"Very good, my dear.  Then order Patient to
be ready."
</p>

<p>
"Is Patient to go, Madam?"
</p>

<p>
"My dear!" said Lady Ingram, "do you think I
mean to travel like a <i>bourgeoise</i>?  Of course Patient
will go.  And be careful that you do not take too
few gowns with you.  I have to spur you, my
<i>réligieuse</i>, or I really think you would scarce know
the difference between silk and camlet.  What a
pity you were not born a Catholic!  I will give the
orders to Patient myself, that will be best.  She is
little better than you in such matters.  I suppose,
in her case, it arises from her being a Scotch-woman,
and of no family.  But how it ever came to
be the case with you, an Ingram of Ingram, I really
cannot understand.  Those things generally run in
the blood.  It must be the people who brought you
up.  They did not look as if they knew anything."
</p>

<p>
"You think so much about family, Madam," said
Celia, stung in the affections by this contemptuous
notice of her dearest friends; "pardon me for
telling you that the Passmores have dwelt at Ashcliffe
for eight hundred years."
</p>

<p>
"My dear, you astonish me!" said Lady Ingram,
with a faint glimmer of interest.  "Then they
really are respectable people!  I assure you I am
quite rejoiced to hear it.  I did think there was
something a little superior in the manner of the
eldest daughter&mdash;something of repose; but you
English are odd&mdash;so different from other people.
Eight hundred years, did you say?  That is quite
interesting."
</p>

<p>
And Lady Ingram dropped another lump of
sugar languidly into her cup of chocolate.
Repose! thought Celia.  Truly in Isabella's manners there
was repose enough; but it had never occurred to
the simple Passmores to regard it as enviable.  On
the contrary, they called it idleness in plain Saxon,
and urged her by all means to get rid of it.
</p>

<p>
"Quite interesting!" repeated Lady Ingram,
stirring up the sugar in a slow, deliberate style
which Isabella would have admired.  "Really, I
did not know that the Passmores were a respectable
family.  I thought they were quite nobodies."

XI.
<br /><br />
HOW PHILIP CAME BACK.
</h3>

<p class="poem2">
  "The hour we see not, when, upsurging full,<br />
  Our cup shall outflow.  God is merciful."<br />
</p>

<p><br /><br /></p>

<p>
"Disengaged, Madam?  I have just half an
hour to spend with you.  Positively the last
time before I don my regimentals.  And then
hurrah for Landrécies!  O Ned, I wonder where
you are!  I wish you would come back!"
</p>

<p>
"Do you travel with us, Philip?"
</p>

<p>
"No, thank you, Madam.  That would be
rather too spicy."
</p>

<p>
"You go with your regiment?"
</p>

<p>
"I have that honor."
</p>

<p>
"Mr. Philip," said Patient, as she noiselessly
entered, "I have done your packing, and"&mdash;
</p>

<p>
"What a darling of a Covenanter you are,
to take that off my hands!"
</p>

<p>
"And I have put a little Bible, Sir, along with
your linen.  Will you please to promise me,
Mr. Philip, to read it?"
</p>

<p>
"Dear Patient," answered Philip, letting his
lightness slip from him like a cloak, "I will read
it.  I have read it so much lately that I should
feel almost lost without it, I assure you."
</p>

<p>
"Have you done aught but read it, Mr. Philip?"
asked Patient, earnestly.
</p>

<p>
"As how?" queried Philip.
</p>

<p>
"Sir, I can conceive of none so awfully far off
God and good as he that handles the bread of life
but never eateth of it, he that standeth just
outside the gate of the fold and never entereth
therein.  Have you felt it, Mr. Philip? have you
believed it? have you prayed over it?"
</p>

<p>
There was no lightness about Philip's tone
or manner as he answered, "I think, Patient,
I have."
</p>

<p>
But Patient was not satisfied yet.
</p>

<p>
"Mr. Philip, my bairn," said she, "I do think
that what you do, you'll do thoroughly&mdash;not half
and half.  I think you will know whether you do
mean to follow the Lord or not.  But 'tis one
thing to mean to go, and another to set out
on your journey; 'tis one thing to think you
can leave all without trying, and another to leave
all.  And I'm no so sure, my dear bairn, whether
you ken your own self, and whether you can leave
all and follow Him.  'Tis rougher walking in the
narrow way than on the broad road.  It takes sore
riving to get through the gate with some.  Can
you hold on?  Can you set the Lord always
before you, above all the jeering and scoffing,
all the coldness and neglect of the world?  For
until the Lord is more to you than any in
this world, you'll scarce be leaving all and
following Him.  Don't be deceived&mdash;don't be deceived!
and oh, laddie dear, dinna deceive your ainsel'!"
</p>

<p>
"My dear old friend!" said Philip, looking
up lovingly into Patient's face.  "I will tell
you the honest truth about myself.  Celia, do you
remember what I said to you the first time that I
saw you?"
</p>

<p>
Celia remembered that well.  It had pained her
too much to be lightly forgotten.
</p>

<p>
"Well, that has all passed away.  I believe that
there is a God, and that the Bible is His revelation
to man.  Colville's philosophy merely disgusts
me now.  (I must say for him, though, that he was
talking unusual nonsense the other night; he
generally has something better to say than
that.)  Well, then, I believe, if I know what believing
means, in Jesus Christ.  Perhaps I <i>don't</i> know
what believing means; I shall not feel astonished
if you tell me so.  I believe that He died to save
sinners, that is, instead of sinners; but instead of
what sinners I don't quite know.  For I cannot
help seeing that while all mankind are sinners,
there is one class of sinners, called saints, who are
quite different from the rest.  My puzzle at present
is what makes the difference.  We all believe
that Christ died for sinners, yet it seems to be only
some of us that get any good from it.  If you can
explain this to me, do so."
</p>

<p>
"I must go back to eternity to explain that,"
said Patient.  "Sir, ages back, ere the world had
a beginning, the Lord God, who alone was in the
beginning, Father, Son, and Spirit, covenanted the
redemption of man.[<a id="chap11fn1text"></a><a href="#chap11fn1">1</a>]  Certain persons, whose
names were written in the Book of Life,[<a id="chap11fn2text"></a><a href="#chap11fn2">2</a>] were
given of the Father to the Son,[<a id="chap11fn3text"></a><a href="#chap11fn3">3</a>] unto whom, and
to none other, the benefits of His redemption were
to be applied.[<a id="chap11fn4text"></a><a href="#chap11fn4">4</a>]  'No man,' quoth our Lord, 'can
come to Me except the Father which hath sent Me
draw him;[<a id="chap11fn5text"></a><a href="#chap11fn5">5</a>] and also, 'All that the Father giveth
Me shall come to Me.'[<a id="chap11fn6text"></a><a href="#chap11fn6">6</a>]  Therefore"&mdash;
</p>

<p>
"Stop, stop!" cried Philip.  "Let me take all
that in before you go on to secondly.  Do you
mean to say, Patient, that God, the loving and
merciful God, who says He wills not the death of
any sinner,[<a id="chap11fn7text"></a><a href="#chap11fn7">7</a>] selected a mere handful of men whom
He chose to save, and deliberately left all the rest
to perish?  Was that love?  Was that like God?"
</p>

<p>
"Sir, we can only know from the Word what is
or is not like God.  He ruleth over all,[<a id="chap11fn8text"></a><a href="#chap11fn8">8</a>] and who
shall say unto Him, 'What doest Thou?'[<a id="chap11fn9text"></a><a href="#chap11fn9">9</a>]  And
when all were sunk in sin, and He might justly
have left all to perish, shall we quarrel with Him
because He in His sovereign grace and electing
love decided to whom the merit of His work, the
free gift of God, should be applied?"
</p>

<p>
"That is Covenanting doctrine, I suppose," said
Philip, dryly.
</p>

<p>
Celia saw breakers a-head.
</p>

<p>
"Dear Patient," she said, very gently, "are you
not trying to feed Philip with rather too strong
meat?  Remember what our Lord said to His disciples,
'I have many things to say unto you, but
ye cannot bear them now.'"[<a id="chap11fn10text"></a><a href="#chap11fn10">10</a>]
</p>

<p>
"Speak you, then, Madam Celia," said Patient.
"I have but one speech."
</p>

<p>
"Oh! you good folks don't always agree!"
observed Philip, as if he had made a discovery.
</p>

<p>
"We quite agree," answered Celia.  "I believe
just what Patient does, but I don't think it is
suited for you.  She is trying to make you spell words
of three syllables before you can say your alphabet
perfectly; and I think it will be better to help you
over the alphabet first.  Dear Philip, those whom
Christ saves are those whom He makes willing to
accept His salvation.  Are you willing?"
</p>

<p>
"Go your own way, Madam," said Patient, in a
dissatisfied tone; "go your own way.  But don't
account me in agreement with the teaching of
Arminius."
</p>

<p>
"My dear Patient, I know nothing about
Arminius&mdash;neither who he is nor what he teaches,"
replied Celia, simply.  "Does not God make His
elect willing to accept His salvation?"
</p>

<p>
"Surely, Madam, surely," answered Patient, a
little mollified.  "But you spake of <i>will</i>, Madam.
Now I never can accept the free-will views of that
heretic Arminius."
</p>

<p>
"Fire away, Patient!" cried Philip, from the
sofa; "I will lay five pounds on you.  Well, really!
I am rejoiced to find that the saints can quarrel
like sinners!  It makes a fellow feel himself
less of an isolation."
</p>

<p>
This was exactly the sentiment which Celia was
most unwilling to foster in Philip's mind.  She
paused a moment, and sent up a prayer for wisdom
before she spoke again.
</p>

<p>
"Dear Philip, the saints after all are only a few
of the sinners.  Patient and I are both human,
therefore open to sin and error.  Don't take what
we say, either of us; take what God says.  He
cannot mistake, and we may.  Patient, you will not
disagree with me in this?"
</p>

<p>
"Not a whit, Madam.  And I ask your pardon if
I spake unadvisedly with my tongue."
</p>

<p>
"And if I did," responded Celia, softly.  "Least
of all should we do it on such a subject as this."
</p>

<p>
"You did not," answered Philip.  "It was the
old bird that was the fighting cock!"
</p>

<p>
"Well, dear Philip," said Celia, turning to her
brother, "this is the great question for you and
me: Are we willing to accept Christ's work, and to
place no reliance upon our own works?  He will
be all or nothing.  We cannot save ourselves
either wholly or in part.  Our salvation is either
done, or to do; and if it be yet to do, it can never
be accomplished."
</p>

<p>
"Then what place do you find for good works in
your system?"
</p>

<p>
"No place, as the efforts of the slave to set himself
free;[<a id="chap11fn11text"></a><a href="#chap11fn11">11</a>] every place, as the endeavor of the child
to show his love to the reconciled father."[<a id="chap11fn12text"></a><a href="#chap11fn12">12</a>]
</p>

<p>
"Well," said Philip, reflectively, "I found long
ago that your view was the soil which grew the
finest crop of them.  Don't look at me so, Patient.
Let me talk as I think; it is natural to my mind to
express itself as I do.  I don't mean anything
wrong."
</p>

<p>
"The Lord will have that out of you, Mr. Philip,
if you be His."
</p>

<p>
"Well," replied Philip, gravely, "I suppose He
knows how."
</p>

<p>
"Ay, He knows how," answered Patient, sadly.
"But don't you give Him more work in that
way than you can help, Sir.  The surgeon's knife
may be very necessary, but it never can be
otherwise than painful."
</p>

<p>
Celia did not quite agree with Patient here; but
it was a secondary point, and she said nothing.
Philip looked at his watch, and, declaring that he
could not stay another minute, kissed Celia and
Patient, saying, "<i>A Landrécies!</i>" as he left the
room.
</p>

<p>
"I see a long, weary walk for Mr. Philip, Madam,"
remarked Patient, when he was gone.  "If
he be to reach the good City at all, 'twill sure be
by a path of much affliction."
</p>

<p>
Celia was rather disposed to think the same.
</p>

<p>
Lady Ingram's expectation that she would be
able to procure only small rooms at Landrécies
was verified.  The apartments to be obtained
were both small and few.  Lady Ingram and Celia
occupied the same bed-chamber.  Until this
happened, Celia had no idea what a very artificial
flower her handsome, stately step-mother really
was.  She now found that the fourth part of her
hair, and nearly three-fourths of her bloom, were
imparted.  Every morning Lady Ingram sat for two
hours under the hands of Thérèse, who powdered
her hair, rouged her cheeks, applied pearl-powder
to her forehead, tweezers to her eyebrows, and
paint to her neck, fixing in also sundry false curls.
</p>

<p>
"My Lady," asked Patient, in her quietest manner,
the first evening at Landrécies, which was the
12th of July, "if the Prince Eugene take us
prisoners, what will become of us, if you please?"
</p>

<p>
"Prisoners!" repeated Lady Ingram.  "Absurd,
Patient!  You speak as if you thought a defeat
possible.  The armies of the <i>Grand Monarque</i> and
those of King James together to be routed by one
Savoyard!  Preposterous!"
</p>

<p>
"They were put to flight at Malplaquet, Madam"
(which place Patient pronounced to rhyme
with jacket); "and 'tis not so many days since the
Prince took Le Quesnoy."[<a id="chap11fn13text"></a><a href="#chap11fn13">13</a>]
</p>

<p>
"Patient Irvine, you are no better than a fool!"
said Lady Ingram, turning round to give effect to
her sentence.
</p>

<p>
"Very like, Madam," was the mild reply of Patient,
who was employed in giving the last fold to
her young lady's dress.  "Indeed, 'tis but the act
of a fool to reason beforehand.  The Lord will
dispose matters."
</p>

<p>
"Celia!  I shall find you another attendant, now
that you can speak French, and send Patient back
to her sewing.  Does she speak in this canting
way to you?"
</p>

<p>
"Pray don't!" was Celia's alarmed reply to the
first part of Lady Ingram's remark.  "No more than
I do to her, Madam," she answered to the second.
</p>

<p>
"I see!" said Lady Ingram, sarcastically.  "A
nice choice of an attendant I made for you!  It
was unavoidable at first, since she was the only
woman in my house, except Thérèse, who could
speak English; but I ought to have changed her
afterwards.  I might have known how it would be.
When we return to Paris, I will provide you with
a French woman."
</p>

<p>
"You will do the Lord's will, Madam," observed
Patient, calmly.
</p>

<p>
"I will do my own!" cried Lady Ingram, more
angrily than was her wont.
</p>

<p>
"Madam," was Patient's answer, "the Lord's
will <i>will</i> be done; and in one sense, whether you
choose it or not, you will have to do it."
</p>

<p>
"Leave the room!  You are a canting hypocrite!"
commanded her mistress, in no dulcet tones.
</p>

<p>
"Yes, my Lady," answered Patient, meekly, and
obeyed.
</p>

<p>
"Now, if that woman had had the least spirit,
she would have answered me again.  A little more
rouge here, Thérèse."
</p>

<p>
And Lady Ingram settled herself peacefully to
her powderings, leaving Celia in a state very far
from peace.  She felt, indeed, extremely rebellious.
</p>

<p>
"Cannot I have my own choice in this matter?"
she thought to herself.  "Am I never to have my
own way?  Must I be forever the slave of this
woman, who is neither my own mother nor one of
the Lord's people?  Shall I calmly let her take
from me my only friend and counsellor?  No!  I
will go back to Ashcliffe first; and if I break with
Lady Ingram altogether, what matters it?"  But
the next minute came other thoughts.  Patient had
told her words of her grandfather's which she
remembered,&mdash;"A soldier hath no right to change
his position."  And how could she put such an
occasion to fall in her brother's way?  Perhaps
the Lord was drying up all the wells in order to
drive her closer to the one perennial fountain.
Ah! poor caged bird, beating against the cage!
She little knew either how near she was to freedom,
nor by what means God would give it to her.
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
The 21st of July dawned.  Lady Ingram had
risen a little earlier than usual, for she expected to
see Philip, and had been grumbling all the
previous evening at his non-appearance.  He came in,
dressed in full regimentals, about eleven o'clock,
when his mother had been down for about an
hour, and Celia for several hours.
</p>

<p>
"Good-morning and good-bye in one," he said,
speaking hastily, and to both at once.  "I have
but ten minutes to stay.  Marshal Villars has
found a weak place in Prince Eugene's intrenchments
at Denain, and he is going to draw his attention
by an attack this morning on the Landrécies
side, while we come up the other way and storm
Denain this afternoon.  Villars himself will be
with us.  Bentinck defends Denain with seventeen
battalions and fourteen squadrons, mostly Dutch.[<a id="chap11fn14text"></a><a href="#chap11fn14">14</a>]  By
the way, Le Marais has heard that Ned is in
camp, but I have not come across him.  You are
sure to see him before long, if he be here."
</p>

<p>
"Philip!" said his mother, suddenly, "the tie of
your cravat is quite a quarter of an inch on one
side!"
</p>

<p>
"A quarter of a fiddle-stick, my dear Mother!"
said Philip, laughing.  "What do you think it will
look like when I have been an hour in action!  I
hope they will let me head a charge.  I expect to
be made a Prince of the Empire at the very least!
Good-bye, Mother."
</p>

<p>
"Adieu, my son," responded Lady Ingram, a
little less languidly than usual.  "Don't go into
danger, Philip."
</p>

<p>
"What admirable advice to an officer of His
Majesty's army!" returned Philip, kissing her.
"Good-bye, little Celia.  I have something to tell
you when I come back."
</p>

<p>
Celia looked up from Philip's kiss into his eyes
to see what it was.  They were deeper and softer
than usual, but she read nothing there.
</p>

<p>
"Good-bye, dear Philip.  God keep you!" she said.
</p>

<p>
"And you&mdash;both," replied Philip, in a softened
tone.  "Adieu!"  And he was gone.
</p>

<p>
All that day Celia could do nothing.  She
wondered to see Lady Ingram sit quietly knotting, as
if the day of the battle of Denain were no more to
her than other days.  But the day passed like
other days; they dined and drank chocolate, and
the dusk came on, and Lady Ingram ceased knotting.
She had been out of the room a few minutes
when Patient put her head in at the door.
</p>

<p>
"Madam," she said, in her quiet, unmoved voice,
"Sir Edward is below, and a strange gentleman
with him.  Will you speak with him while I find
my Lady?"
</p>

<p>
Celia rose and went down into the dining-room,
very curious to make the acquaintance of her
unknown brother.  But it was not the unknown
brother upon whom her eyes first fell.  She saw
merely that he was there&mdash;a tall, dark, grave-looking
man; but beside him stood a fair-haired man,
a little older than himself, and with a cry of
"Harry!  dear, dear Harry!" Celia flew to him.
Harry's greeting was quite as warm as Celia's, but
graver.
</p>

<p>
"Who has won?" was her first question.  She
wondered afterwards that it should have been so.
</p>

<p>
"The allies," answered Harry, quietly.  "I am
Sir Edward's prisoner."
</p>

<p>
"A prisoner whom I yield to my sister, to be
disposed of at her pleasure," said Edward, coming
forward; and Celia, turning from Harry, greeted
and thanked the real brother cordially, though a
little shyly.
</p>

<p>
"Have you seen Philip?" she asked of both.
Her apprehensions were beginning to subside.
</p>

<p>
We rarely know the supreme moments of our
lives till they are past.  We open laughing the
letter which contains awful tidings; we look up
brightly to see the unclosing of the door&mdash;
</p>

<p>
  "Which lets in on us such disabling news,<br />
  We ever after have been graver."[<a id="chap11fn15text"></a><a href="#chap11fn15">15</a>]<br />
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
It was with a lightened heart, and almost a
smile, that Celia asked if her brothers (as she
considered both) had seen Philip; and full of
apprehension as her heart had been all day, she did not
guess the answer from the dead silence that ensued.
</p>

<p>
Harry was the first to speak, and he addressed
himself to Sir Edward.  "You, or I?" was his
enigmatical question.
</p>

<p>
"You," answered Edward, shortly.
</p>

<p>
"Celia, darling!" began Harry, looking back at
her with deep compassion in his eyes; and he got
no further.  And then she knew.
</p>

<p>
"O Philip, Philip!" broke in a bitter wail from
the lips of the sister who had learned to love
Philip so much.  "Are you sure?  Have you seen
him?" she asked, turning first to Harry and then
to Edward, hoping against hope that there might
be some mistake.
</p>

<p>
"I have seen him," replied Edward; and her
hope died away.
</p>

<p>
"Celia," resumed Edward, "listen, dear sister.
I have seen Philip; there can be no mistake on
that score.  He will be brought here soon.  But
I have seen also something else, for which,
knowing him as I do, I thank God so much that as yet
I have hardly begun to grieve at all.  He lies just
where he fell at the head of his troops, after one
of the finest and bravest charges that I ever
witnessed in my life: his face turned to God and the
foe.  But this lay close to his heart.  Look at it."
</p>

<p>
Celia took from her brother's hand the little
book which he held out to her.  She saw at once
that it was a Testament, but the leaves were glued
together with a terrible red, at which Celia
shuddered as she tried to open them.
</p>

<p>
"The first leaf," was Edward's direction.
</p>

<p>
She recognized Philip's well-known hand as she
turned to it.  At the head of the fly-leaf Lady
Ingram's name and address were faintly pencilled;
and below were a few lines in darker and fresher
lead.  Celia dashed the intrusive tears from her
eyes before she could read them.
</p>

</p>

<p>
The little book trembled in Celia's hand, and
she broke into a fresh shower of uncontrollable
weeping.  Her companions allowed her to indulge
her sorrow for a few moments in silence.  Then
Edward said gently, "Who shall tell his mother?"
</p>

<p>
"I will," she answered, ceasing her tears by a
violent effort; and she left the room, and went
up-stairs at once.  Lady Ingram was seated at
her knotting.
</p>

<p>
"Where have you been?" she asked, without
looking at her step-daughter, for just then the
knotting was at a difficult point, and required all
her attention.
</p>

<p>
Instead of answering, Celia knelt down by her,
and uttered one word&mdash;a word she had never
used to her before.
</p>

<p>
"Mother!"
</p>

<p>
Lady Ingram dropped her work, and looked
into Celia's face.
</p>

<p>
"My dear," she said, her voice slightly trembling,
"you have bad news to tell me.  At once,
if you please&mdash;I do not like things broken gradually."
</p>

<p>
At once Celia told her: "Philip is killed."
</p>

<p>
With a wild shriek which rang through the
house, Philip's mother flung up her arms&mdash;as
Celia remembered that, once before in her life,
Claude De L'Orient had done&mdash;and then fell back
heavily and silently in her chair.  Celia, ignorant
and terrified, threw open the door and called for
Patient and Thérèse.  They came in together, the
former quiet and practical, the latter screaming
and wringing her hands.
</p>

<p>
"Eh, my faith!  Madam is dead!" shrieked Thérèse.
</p>

<p>
"'Tis but a dwawm, Madam," was the decision
of Patient.  "Please to open the window.
Thérèsa, cut her Ladyship's lace[<a id="chap11fn18text"></a><a href="#chap11fn18">18</a>] whilst I fetch her
water."
</p>

<p>
"But, my dear friend," remonstrated Thérèse,
with an invocation in addition, "that will spoil
her figure!"
</p>

<p>
"Go down-stairs and fetch a glass of water,"
said Patient, with a spice of scorn.  "That's all
<i>you</i> are fit for.  Madam, will you please to hold her
Ladyship's head while I get at her lace and cut it?"
</p>

<p>
Patient's remedies applied, Lady Ingram partly
recovered herself in a few minutes.  Edward was
by her side when she again opened her eyes.
They rested for an instant on him and on Celia,
and closed again with a long tremulous sigh
which seemed to come from her heart.
</p>

<p>
"If you will please to give me orders, Madam,"
said Patient, quietly, to Celia, "I think her
Ladyship will be best in her bed, and she scarce seems
knowledgeable to give orders herself.  Will I and
Thérèsa lay her there?"
</p>

<p>
Celia spoke to Lady Ingram, but received no
answer, and she gave Patient the order.  So
Patient and Thérèse undressed the still figure and
laid her to rest.  Lady Ingram continued to sleep
or swoon, whichever it were; she seemed
occasionally sensible to pain, but not to sound, nor
did she appear to know who was about her.
</p>

<p>
About ten o'clock, Celia, seated at her step-mother's
bed-side, heard a regular tramp of soldiers'
feet below, and knew too well what they
must be bringing.  A few minutes afterwards her
brother softly entered the room.
</p>

<p>
"Celia, they have brought Philip here.  Will you
come and see him?"
</p>

<p>
She hesitated a minute, half for Lady Ingram,
and half for herself.
</p>

<p>
"There is nothing painful or shocking, dear; I
would not ask you if there were.  Would you like
to see him again or not?"
</p>

<p>
Celia rose and gave Edward her hand.  He led
her silently down to the dining-room, leaving her
to go in the first by herself and kneel beside the
still, white clay which only five hours earlier had
been Philip Ingram.
</p>

<p>
Ah! if she only could have known, what might
she not have said to him!  Had she said enough?
Had she done her duty?&mdash;her utmost?  Had she
pressed Christ and His salvation on him as she
ought to have done?  Where was Philip now?
</p>

<p class="poem">
  "Oh, that <i>had!</i> how sad a passage 'tis!"[<a id="chap11fn19text"></a><a href="#chap11fn19">19</a>]<br />
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
Oh, that <i>might have been!</i> how much sadder!
</p>

<p>
Edward and Harry came in and stood by her.
</p>

<p>
"Can either of you tell me anything more?"
she faltered, her eyes riveted on the calm, fixed,
white face which would never tell anything more
to her.
</p>

<p>
"I can," answered Harry Passmore, softly.  "I
heard his last words."
</p>

<p>
"O Harry, tell me!" pleaded Celia.
</p>

<p>
"I was stationed just opposite," he said, "and
it was my regiment that received the charge.  A
shot killed the horse of the officer in command,
and he too fell.  I knew not whether he had
received injury himself, and I was so much struck
by his youth and bravery that I pressed forward to
aid him.  But as soon as I saw his face, I found
that the shot had struck more than the horse.
At this moment my adjutant spoke to me, calling
me 'Colonel Passmore.'  When he heard that, he
saith from where he lay, 'Are you Harry Passmore
of Ashcliffe?'  'Yes,' I said, wondering that
he could know me.  'You are Celia's brother,
then,' quoth he, with the ghost of a smile, 'and so
am I.  Take this to her.  The address is on the
fly-leaf.'  I was so amazed that I could but utter,
'Are you Philip Ingram?'  'I am,' he saith, his
breathing now very quick and short.  'Tell my
mother gently.  Take care of Celia.'  His voice
now failed him, and I bent my head close that I
might hear anything more.  I heard only as if he
whispered to himself, 'The uttermost!'  Then
came a long sobbing sigh, and then all was over."
</p>

<p>
"God forbid that we should limit that uttermost!"
murmured Edward, softly.
</p>

<p>
"O Edward!" sobbed his sister, "do you think
he is safe?"
</p>

<p>
"My sister," he replied, very gently, "can I tell
you more than God does?  'To the uttermost'[<a id="chap11fn20text"></a><a href="#chap11fn20">20</a>]
and 'he that believeth.'[<a id="chap11fn21text"></a><a href="#chap11fn21">21</a>]  But if you had known
Philip as I knew him, you would feel with me that
something must have happened to him, which had
made an immense difference between what he was
and is.  I cannot think that something anything
short of the redeeming love of Christ.  God knows,
dear, what are the boundaries of His uttermost.  I
can scarce think they are closer than our uttermosts."
</p>

<p>
"Yet outside the fold is outside," said Celia,
falteringly.
</p>

<p>
"I did not mean for one moment to deny that,"
said he; "I expressed myself ill if you thought so.
But we are told&mdash;'According to your faith be it
unto you,'[<a id="chap11fn22text"></a><a href="#chap11fn22">22</a>] and of what may come from 'faith as a
grain of mustard-seed.'[<a id="chap11fn23text"></a><a href="#chap11fn23">23</a>]  And it seems to me that
the words on that leaf had never been penned by
such a hand as Philip's, unless his faith were at
least equal to a grain of mustard-seed.  Remember,
dear heart, that in His hand who will not break the
bruised reed, nor quench the smoking flax,[<a id="chap11fn24text"></a><a href="#chap11fn24">24</a>] are the
keys of Death and of Hell.[<a id="chap11fn25text"></a><a href="#chap11fn25">25</a>] I can trust Him to
do right, even to the brother I loved so well."
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
Lady Ingram returned to consciousness on the
following day, but Thérèse reported that she was
very weak and low, and desired to see no one but
herself.  On the Sunday morning she suddenly
sent for Celia and Edward.  They found her lying
propped up by pillows, her eyes sunk and heavy,
and her face very pale.  She recognized her
step-children with a faint smile.
</p>

<p>
"Come and kiss me, Edward," she said, in a low
soft voice: "I have scarce seen you yet.  And Celia,
too.  You loved him, both of you.  Now listen to
me, and I will tell you what I shall do.  As soon
as my health and strength admit, I shall take the
veil at the convent of Sainte Marie de Chaillot.  I
have no more to live for.  You are both old
enough to take care of yourselves.  And, after all,
life in this world is not everything.  I shall make
my retreat, and after some years of penance and
prayer, I trust I shall have grace to make my
conversion.  You, Edward&mdash;do you propose to remain
in the army?"
</p>

<p>
"I do not think I shall, Mother."
</p>

<p>
"You will keep up your estates?"
</p>

<p>
"I should prefer living in England."
</p>

<p>
"And Celia; what will you do, my dear?"
</p>

<p>
"I shall go back to Ashcliffe if nobody want me.
If Edward wish me to live with him I will willingly
do so, especially in England; but even then I
should like to pay a long visit to Ashcliffe before
settling anywhere else."
</p>

<p>
"I should be very happy to have you with me,
dear," said Edward, quietly, to this; "but I do not
wish to be any tie to you.  There is no necessity
for your living with me, for I am about to marry.
So pray do which you prefer."
</p>

<p>
"Whom are you about to marry, Edward?"
asked Lady Ingram, turning to him with a look of
some interest in her languid eyes.
</p>

<p>
"None whom you know, Mother.  One with
whom I met on my travels."
</p>

<p>
"I am glad you are marrying," she said, "And
how is Celia to return to Ashcliffe?"
</p>

<p>
"Oh! with Harry," replied Celia, quickly.
</p>

<p>
"He is not at liberty yet," observed Edward,
gravely.
</p>

<p>
"But you will set him free to go with me?"
entreated his sister.
</p>

<p>
"I have nothing to do with it.  You will, I
suppose.  I make you a present of my prisoner."
</p>

<p>
"Oh, thank you!  If Harry's liberty depends on
me, he shall have it directly."
</p>

<p>
"Edward," said Lady Ingram, "I have a favor
to ask from you."
</p>

<p>
"Name it, and take it, Mother."
</p>

<p>
"Will you see that a small pension is settled on
Thérèse; and, should she wish to continue in her
present position, interest yourself in obtaining for
her another situation?"
</p>

<p>
"I will attend to her interests as honestly and
thoroughly as I think you would yourself."
</p>

<p>
"I do not recommend Patient to you, since she
is already rather your servant than mine, and you
will be careful of her, I know.  Celia has a great
liking for her: I dare say she will wish to take her
to England."
</p>

<p>
"Do you object to that, Madam?" asked Celia.
</p>

<p>
"Not in the least," replied Lady Ingram.
</p>

<p>
"Do you?" continued Celia, this time addressing
Edward.
</p>

<p>
"For a time, certainly not.  I should not like to
part with her altogether; but, on the other hand,
I should not allow you to travel to England
without a woman in your company.  Patient shall go
with you, and after my marriage let her return to
me, wherever I may resolve to dwell."
</p>

<p>
"Thank you.  You will write to me, then?"
</p>

<p>
"I will come to you, if you are willing to
receive me.  We have seen very little of each other
yet."
</p>

<p>
"Very little," said Celia, rather sadly.
</p>

<p>
"Now, my children, leave me," requested Lady
Ingram, faintly.  "I am too weak to converse
much.  Send Patient to me."
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
Ten days later saw them journeying in company
by easy stages to Paris; and ten days after that
witnessed a solemn ceremony in the convent chapel
of Sainte Marie de Chaillot, at which Queen Maria
Beatrice, Madame de Maintenon, and a brilliant
crowd of distinguished persons were present, when
Claude Ingram took upon herself the white veil of
a postulant.  Edward and Celia were there, the
latter with a slight misgiving whether she were
not sanctioning idolatry to some extent, even by
her appearance: a suspicion not laid to rest by the
manifest disapproval and uncompromising speeches
of Patient.  "'Can a man take fire in his bosom,
and his clothes not be burned?'"[<a id="chap11fn26text"></a><a href="#chap11fn26">26</a>] asked she.  But
Celia was determined to see the last of Lady
Ingram; and Edward promised to lead her out before
anything objectionable began.  To her it was an
inexpressibly mournful ceremony.  The different
stages of the rites&mdash;the shearing off of the glossy
hair, the taking of the vows, the white veil of the
postulant&mdash;all seemed to her as so many epitaphs
on the grave of a living woman.  When the brother
and sister went down to the guest-chamber to take
leave of the novice, Celia was sobbing hysterically.
</p>

<p>
Lady Ingram parted from both with a very warm
embrace.  She appeared much softened.
</p>

<p>
"Farewell, my child!" she said to Celia.  "And
you will not live always in England?  You will
come and see me at least once more?  And when
you pray to God in your <i>prêches</i>, do not quite
forget Soeur Marie Angélique."
</p>

<p>
Celia turned from the convent-gate with a sadder
heart than she ever thought she could have felt
at her parting from Claude Ingram.
</p>

<p>
Only for three days longer did she remain in
Paris.  The house was very painful to her now.
In everything Philip lived again for her; and she
became very anxious to get home to Ashcliffe.  Of
the warmth and cordiality of her reception there it
never occurred to her to doubt.  So on the 14th of
August, Celia, Harry, and Patient left Paris on
their way to England, escorted by Edward as far
as Havre.

<p>
The <i>Naws-Letter</i> had just come in, posted from
London, and Squire Passmore sat down in the
parlor to read it.  It was a warm, but wet, autumn
afternoon.  The embroidery frame was covered
with a wrapper, and Isabella and her mother were
tying up preserves and labelling them.  Two large
trays of them stood on the parlor-table, and Cicely
came slowly in with another.
</p>

<p>
"Well, sure, that's main heavy!" said she.  "If
you please, Sir, is there aught by the post from
Master Harry?" she added, with a courtesy.
</p>

<p>
"Nothing, Cicely, nothing," said the Squire,
looking up from his newspaper.  "I don't know what
has come to the lad.  He did scribble one line to
let us know that he was not killed, but not a word
have we had from him since."
</p>

<p>
"Mayhap he's a-coming," suggested Cicely.
</p>

<p>
"I wish he were," sighed Madam Passmore.
</p>

<p>
A merry laugh outside announced somebody, and
the door sprang open to the united attacks of Pero
and Lucy.
</p>

<p>
"Anything from Harry?" was her question too,
and she received the same answer.
</p>

<p>
And "Anything from Harry?" asked Charley,
sauntering in with his hands in his pockets.
</p>

<p>
"These are done, Cicely," said Madam Passmore.
"Take them hence, and fetch another tray;
and bid Dolly, if any should come on such a wet
day, to have a care that she brings them not hither,
but into the drawing-room&mdash;unless, of course, it
were Harry," she added in a doubtful tone.
</p>

<p>
"Oh dear, Mother!" exclaimed Isabella, who
had gone to the window, "here is a coach coming
up but now."
</p>

<p>
Lucy was at the window in a second.
</p>

<p>
"Well, who is coming out?" she soliloquized.
"An old woman&mdash;at least, no&mdash;she's not old, but
she's older than I am"&mdash;
</p>

<p>
"You don't say so!" commented Charley,
incredulously.
</p>

<p>
"Have done, Charley!&mdash;and the fattest little
yellow dog&mdash;oh, such a funny one!&mdash;and&mdash;why, 'tis
Harry! and Celia!  Celia herself!"
</p>

<p>
An announcement which sent the whole family to
the door at different paces, Lucy heading them.
Celia felt herself obliged to greet everybody at once.
Lucy was clinging to her on one side, and Charley
on the other; Madam Passmore was before her, and
the Squire and Isabella met her at the parlor-door.
</p>

<p>
"I am fain to see thee once more, child!" was
the Squire's greeting; "but what a crinkum-crankum
that woman has made of thee!"
</p>

<p>
"She looks quite elegant," said Isabella, kissing
her with a little less languor than usual.
</p>

<p>
"Don't tease her, Charley; she is very tired,"
said Harry, when he could get in a word.  "We
have had a long stage to-day."
</p>

<p>
So Celia was established in an enormous easy-chair,
and propped up with cushions, until she
laughingly declared that she would require all the
united strength of the family to help her out
again; and Lucy was busy attempting to divest
her of her out-door apparel, without having the
least idea how to do it.
</p>

<p>
"Shall I take your hat and cloak up-stairs,
Madam?" said Patient, entering with a general
courtesy.
</p>

<p>
"Celia, what have you done with your yellow dog?"
</p>

<p>
"O dear!" cried Celia, in a tone of distress.
"I was so taken up with you that I forgot her.
Where is he, Patient?"
</p>

<p>
"'Tis a-sniffling and a-snuffling about, Madam,"
said Patient.
</p>

<p>
"Call her," replied Celia.
</p>

<p>
"Dog!" summoned Patient&mdash;for Patient
scorned to pollute her lips with the heathen name
which it had pleased Lady Ingram to bestow
upon her pet.  But Venus was accustomed to
the generic epithet from Patient, and came trotting
up at her call.  Patient shut the little animal
in and herself out.  Venus waddled slowly up the
room, sniffing at every member of the family in
turn, until she came to Celia, at whom she
wagged her curly tail and half her fat body, and
coiled herself in peace upon a hassock at her
feet.
</p>

<p>
"Celia," asked the Squire, "did you search all
Paris, or offer a reward, for the ugliest dog that
could be brought you?"
</p>

<p>
"By no means, Father.  The dog is a bequest
from my step-mother.  It was her special pet,
and I have not the conscience to discard it, if I
had the heart."
</p>

<p>
"Is she dead, my dear?  I see you are in black
for some person," asked Madam Passmore.
</p>

<p>
The glad light died out of Celia's eyes, and her
voice sank to a low, saddened tone.
</p>

<p>
"No, Mother; she has taken the veil at Chaillot.
I am in black for Philip&mdash;my brother Philip&mdash;who
died at Denain."
</p>

<p>
"Are you then come to us for good, my dear?"
asked Madam Passmore, tenderly.
</p>

<p>
"For good, Mother, if you will have me, and I
think you will.  Only that I have promised to see
my step-mother again, but my visit to her cannot
last above a day, and will not be for some time
to come."
</p>

<p>
"Have thee, my dear child!" murmured Madam
Passmore, as if the reverse were the most
preposterous notion of which she had ever heard.
</p>

<p>
"Do widows make nuns of themselves?" asked
Charley.  "I thought they were always girls, and
that they walled them up alive when they had
done with them!"
</p>

<p>
"And your woman, my dear?"
</p>

<p>
"I want to plead with you for her, Mother.
She has been the best friend I have had&mdash;except
Philip: and she is but lent to me for a time.  She
was my brother Edward's nurse, and when he
wants her again he will come and fetch her.  I
thought you not mind my bringing her with me."
</p>

<p>
"What should I mind, my dear?  If you have
found her a true and faithful waiting-woman, and
love her, let her by all means abide with you and
serve you.  Such are not to be picked up everywhere."
</p>

<p>
"My dear," asked the Squire, uneasily, "I hope
they have not made a Tory of you, Celia?"
</p>

<p>
"I don't know, really, Father," was the answer.
"I scarce think there is much difference between
Whigs and Tories.  They all seem to me devoid
of honesty."
</p>

<p>
The Squire looked horror-struck.
</p>

<p>
"Nobody has made a Papist of me, if that be
any consolation to you.  I return as true a
Protestant as I went."
</p>

<p>
"Is this woman a Tory?" gasped the Squire.
</p>

<p>
"Patient?  No, Father," replied Celia, smiling,
"she is a little on the other side of you.  She
calls Oliver Cromwell 'His Highness the Lord
Protector,' and won't allow that King Charles was
a martyr."
</p>

<p>
"Celia, child, thou hast been in ill company!"
solemnly pronounced the Squire.
</p>

<p>
"I was afraid you would think so.  But I
thought I was bound to obey my step-mother in
all things not wrong"&mdash;
</p>

<p>
"Surely, child, surely!" assented Madam Passmore.
</p>

<p>
"Therefore, Father&mdash;I hope you will forgive
me, but I cannot in honesty keep it from you&mdash;I
did not refuse her wish that I should be presented
to Queen Mary."
</p>

<p>
The Squire gasped for breath.  "Presented!"
was the only word he could utter.
</p>

<p>
"I was afraid that it would vex you, when you
came to know, dear Father," said Celia, very
gently; "but you see, I was placed in such a
position that I could not help vexing either you
or my step-mother; and I thought that perchance
I ought to obey that one in whose charge I was
at the time.  I did not like to go, I assure you;
but I wished to do right.  Do you think I did
wrong, Father?"
</p>

<p>
"Now, John," said Madam Passmore, before
the Squire could speak, "I won't have the child
teased and made unhappy, in particular when she
has only just come home.  She meant to do
right, and she did right as far as she knew.  You
must pocket your politics for once."
</p>

<p>
"Well, well, child," confessed the Squire at
last, "we none of us do right at all times, I
reckon, and thou art a good child in the main,
and I forgive thee.  I suppose there may be a
few Tories who will manage to get into Heaven."
</p>

<p>
"I hope so," replied Celia, gravely.
</p>

<p>
"So do I, child&mdash;so do I; though I am a crusty
old Whig at the best of times.  But I do think
they will have to leave their Toryism on this side."
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
When Celia went up-stairs, to give a longer and
fuller greeting to old Cicely Aggett than she had
the opportunity of doing before, she heard the
unusual sound of voices proceeding from Cicely's
little room.  She soon found that Cicely and Patient
were in close converse on a point of theology,
and paused a moment, not wishing to interrupt
them.
</p>

<p>
"Well, truly, I ben't so much troubled with pride
as some other things," Cicely was saying.  "You
see, Mrs. Patient, I hasn't got nothing to be proud
of.  That's where it is.  If I was a well-favored
young damsel with five hundred pounds in my
pocket, and a silk gown, and a coach for to ride
in, well, I dare say I should be as stuck-up as a
peacock.  But whatever has an old sinner like
me to be proud of?  Why, I'm always doing
somewhat wrong all day long."
</p>

<p>
"I am afraid I am a greater sinner than you,
Mrs. Cicely," said Patient Irvine's quiet voice in
answer.  "You have nothing to be proud of, and
you are not proud.  I have nothing to be proud of,
and I am."
</p>

<p>
"Well, surely, a white devil is the worst devil,"
responded Cicely.
</p>

<p>
"Aye, he is so," answered Patient.  "If He was
'meek and lowly in heart'[<a id="chap12fn1text"></a><a href="#chap12fn1">1</a>] which 'did no sin,
neither was guile found in His mouth,'[<a id="chap12fn2text"></a><a href="#chap12fn2">2</a>] what
should we be who are for ever sinning?  I tell you,
Mrs. Cicely, some of the worst bouts of pride that
ever I had, have been just the minute after I had
been humbling myself before the Lord.  Depend
upon it, there is no prouder man in all the world
than the man who is proud of his humility."
</p>

<p>
There was no audible answer from Cicely.
Celia came softly forward.
</p>

<p>
"Eh, my dear!" cried old Cicely, looking up at
her.  "I am so fain to see you back as never was!
Sit ye down a bit, Mrs. Celia, dear heart, and tell
me how it has gone with you this long time."
</p>

<p>
"Very well, dear Cicely, as concerns the Lord's
dealings with me, and very ill as concerns my
dealings with Him."
</p>

<p>
"That's a right good saying, my dear.  Ah! the
good between Him and us is certain sure to be all
on His side.  We are cruel bad, all on us.  And
did you like well, sweetheart?"
</p>

<p>
"That she did not," said Patient, when Celia
hesitated.  "She has not had a bit of her own way
since she left you."
</p>

<p>
Celia laughed, and then grew serious.  "My
own way is bad for me, Patient."
</p>

<p>
"I never knew one for whom it was not, Madam,
except the few who were so gracious that the
Lord's way was their way."
</p>

<p>
"Well, I'd lief be like that," said Cicely.  "The
King couldn't be no better off than so."
</p>

<p>
"So would I," Celia began; "but I am afraid
that if I say the truth, it will be to add 'in
everything but one.'"
</p>

<p>
"Now, my dear young lady," said Patient, turning
to her, "don't you go to grieve in this way for
Mr. Philip, as you have been doing ever since.  I had
no thought till then how he had twined himself
round either your heart or mine.  Do you think,
my bairn, that the Lord, who laid down His life for
him, loved him so much less than we?"
</p>

<p>
"O Patient! if it were only my loss!"
</p>

<p>
"Whose then, Madam?"
</p>

<p>
"I mean," said Celia, explanatorily, "if I could
be sure that it was his gain."
</p>

<p>
Patient did not reply for a moment.  "I ask
your pardon, Madam," she said at length; "I did
not know the direction in which your fears were
travelling.  The less, perhaps, that I had none to
join them."
</p>

<p>
"I am surprised to hear you, Patient!" said
Celia.  "Only the last time that we saw him
before he bade us adieu, you seemed to feel so
doubtful about him."
</p>

<p>
"That was not the last time that I saw him,
Madam.  The next morn, ere he set out, I heard him
conversing with Mr. Colville.  They were on the
stairs, and I was disposing of your linen above.
Now I knew that all his life long the one thing
which Mr. Philip could not bear was scorn.  It was
the thing whereof I was doubtful if he would not
stand ill, 'and in time of temptation fall away.'[<a id="chap12fn3text"></a><a href="#chap12fn3">3</a>]  And
that morn I heard Mr. Colville speaking to
him in a way which, three months earlier, would
have sent his blood up beyond anything I could
name;&mdash;gibing, and mocking, and flouting, taunting
him with listening to a parcel of old women's
stories, and not being man enough to disbelieve,
and the like&mdash;deriding him, yea, making him a
very laughing-stock.  And Mr. Philip stood his
ground; John Knox himself could have been no
firmer.  He listened without a word till Mr. Colville
had ended; and then he said, as quietly and
gently as you could yourself, Madam,&mdash;'Farewell,
Colville,' saith he; 'we have been friends, but all
is over now betwixt you and me.  I will be the
friend of no man who is the enemy of Christ.  He
is more to me than you are&mdash;yes, more than all
the world!'  Madam, do you think I could hear
that, and dare to dispute the salvation of a man
who could set Christ above all the world?  Now,
you understand why I had no fear for Mr. Philip."
</p>

<p>
"He never said so much as that to me," replied
Celia, with her eyes moist and glistening.
</p>

<p>
"He would have done so presently, Madam."
</p>

<p>
"But, Patient, it was so short a time after he
had spoken so differently!"
</p>

<p>
"Ah, Madam! doth that offend you?  The
Lord can ripen His fruit very fast when He sees
good, and hath more ways than one to do it.  He
knew that Mr. Philip's time was short.  We can
scarce tell how sweetly and surely He can carry
the lambs in His bosom until we have been
borne there with them."
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
The next morning Isabella brought forward her
embroidery-frame, occupied just now by a brilliant
worsted parrot and a couple of gorgeous peacocks,
the former seated on a branch full of angles, the
latter strutting about on a brown ground.  The
most important shade in the parrot's very showy
tail was still wanting.
</p>

<p>
"Have you any work for me, Mother?" asked
Celia.  "I do not wish to sit idle."
</p>

<p>
"I can find you some, my dear.  Here is a set
of handkerchiefs and some cravats for Father,
which all want hemming, and I have been obliged
to work at them myself till now: Lucy scarce
does well enough, and Bell is too busy with yonder
birds."
</p>

<p>
"I will relieve you of those, Mother."
</p>

<p>
And Celia took the basket and established
herself near the window.
</p>

<p>
"Mr. John Rowe to speak with Madam," was
Dolly's announcement directly afterwards, and
Madam Passmore left the room.
</p>

<p>
Charley and Lucy were learning their lessons.  In
other words, Charley was sitting with his Æneid
and the Lexicon open on the table before him,
bestowing his attention on everything in the room
except those two volumes; while Lucy, seated at
the window on a hassock, was behaving in much
the same way to a slate.
</p>

<p>
"What a constant plague that man is!" said
Isabella, as she sorted her wools.  "There is no
doing anything for him.  I do believe he has
been here every day for the last fortnight."
</p>

<p>
"Oh, I say!" commented Charley; "take that
<i>cum grano salis</i>, Celia.  I think he has been three
times."
</p>

<p>
"Don't dispute with Bell, Charley; it doesn't
signify."
</p>

<p>
"My dear, he won't dispute with me," observed
Isabella, calmly, selecting different shades of
scarlet.  "I never dispute&mdash;it is too much trouble,
takes my attention from my work."
</p>

<p>
She went on comparing her scarlets, and Charley,
on receiving this rebuke, buried himself for five
minutes in the adventures of Æneas.  For a time
all was silence except for the slight sound of Celia's
needle and Lucy's slate-pencil.
</p>

<p>
"Where is Father?" inquired Madam Passmore,
coming into the room with a rather troubled
look.
</p>

<p>
Charley was up in a second.  "He is in the
stable; I saw him go.  Shall I run and fetch
him?"
</p>

<p>
"Ask him to come to me in the dining-room."
</p>

<p>
And both Charley and his mother disappeared.
</p>

<p>
"What is the matter now?" asked Lucy; but
as nobody answered her, she went back to her
arithmetic.
</p>

<p>
In about half an hour more, Madam Passmore
entered, looking grave and thoughtful.
</p>

<p>
"Isabella, my child," she said, "I have
something to tell thee."
</p>

<p>
Isabella looked up for a moment, and then went
back to her wools.  "Well, Mother?" she queried,
carelessly.
</p>

<p>
"My dear, I will not disguise from thee that
John Rowe's visit concerneth thee.  He hath
asked leave of thy father and me in order to his
becoming thy servant.  Now, dear child, neither I
nor thy father desire to control thy choice; thou
shalt speak for thyself.  What sayest thou?  Wilt
thou marry John Rowe, or not?"
</p>

<p>
"My dear mother!" responded Isabella, still
busy with the wools, "he will come to the wedding
in a blue coat and a lilac waistcoat and lavender
small-clothes!"
</p>

<p>
"I dare say, if thou art so particular, that he
will dress in what color thou wouldst," said Madam
Passmore, smiling.  "But what is thy mind,
child?  Dost thou like him?"
</p>

<p>
"I don't care anything about him, but I cannot
abide his suits," returned the young lady,
comparing the skeins.
</p>

<p>
"Mother isn't asking you to marry his clothes,
Bell!" exclaimed Charley.
</p>

<p>
"My dear, I am not asking her to marry him,"
said Madam Passmore; "I only wish to know her
mind about it.  If thou dost not care about him,
child, I suppose thou wilt wish us to refuse his
addresses?"
</p>

<p>
"No, I don't say that exactly," replied Isabella,
undoing one of her two skeins.
</p>

<p>
"Then what dost thou wish, my dear?" inquired
Madam Passmore, looking rather puzzled.
</p>

<p>
"Oh! do wait a minute, till I settle this red,"
said Isabella.  "I beg your pardon, Mother&mdash;yes,
that will do.  Dear, 'tis quite a weight off my
mind!  Now then for this other matter."
</p>

<p>
"Child, the other matter imports rather to thee,
surely, than the colors of thy worsteds!"
</p>

<p>
"I am sure it does not, Mother, asking your
pardon.  I have been all the morning over these
reds.  Well, as to John Rowe, I don't much mind
marrying him if he will let me choose his suits,
and give me two hundred pounds a year pin-money,
and keep me a coach-and-pair, and take
me up to London at least once in ten years.  I
don't think of anything else.  Please to ask him."
</p>

<p>
"Don't much mind!" repeated her mother,
looking dissatisfied and perplexed.  "Bell, dear
child, I fear thou dost not apprehend the import
of that thou dost.  'Tis a choice for thy whole life,
child!  Do think upon it, and leave thy worsteds
alone for a while!"
</p>

<p>
"If you want a downright answer, Mother, you
shall have it," returned Isabella, with the air of
one ending an unpleasant interruption.  "I will
marry John Rowe if he will keep me a coach-and-pair,
and give me two hundred a year pin-money,
and take me to London&mdash;say once every four
years&mdash;I may as well do it thoroughly while I am
about it&mdash;and of course let me drive in the Ring,
and go to Ranelagh and Vauxhall, and see the
lions in the Tower, and go to St. James's, and all
on in that way.  There! now that is settled."
</p>

<p>
Madam Passmore looked scarcely more satisfied
than before, but she said, "Well, my dear, if
that be thy wish, thou hadst better go and speak
with John Rowe, and let him know thy conditions."
</p>

<p>
"O Mother! with all these worsteds on my
lap!" deprecated Isabella, raising her eyebrows.
</p>

<p>
"Put them here, Bell," interposed Celia,
holding her apron.
</p>

<p>
Isabella reluctantly disposed her worsteds and
rose.
</p>

<p>
"I wish John Rowe were far enough!" she said,
as she left the room.
</p>

<p>
"Dear, dear, child!" murmured Madam Passmore,
looking doubtfully after her daughter.
</p>

<p>
"She is very like my step-mother," said Celia,
quietly.  "She reminds me of her many a time."
</p>

<p>
"Now then!" said Isabella, triumphantly
re-entering.  "I have sent him away, and told him
he must not come teasing when I am busy.  When
I had just found the right shade of red!  Look at
this bracelet he has given me&mdash;pretty, is it not?
He has promised all I asked, and to give me a
black footman as well.  I shall not repent
marrying him, I can see."
</p>

<p>
"Is that happiness, my dear Isabella?"
</p>

<p>
"Happiness!" replied Bell, stopping in her
business of transferring the wools from Celia's
apron to her own.  "Of course!  Why, there are
not above half a dozen families in the country
that have black servants!  I wonder at your
asking such a question, Celia."
</p>

<p>
"I say, Bell," queried Charley, just before
taking himself and Virgil out of the room, "I
wonder which of you two is going to say the
'obey' in the service?"
</p>

<p>
"That boy's impertinence really gets insufferable,"
placidly observed Isabella, seating herself at
the frame.  "Now to finish my parrot's tail."
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
The wedding of John Rowe and Isabella Passmore
was celebrated in the following spring.
Thanks to the bride's taste and orders, the
bridegroom's attire was faultless.  The black
footman proved so excessively black, and rolled the
whites of his eyes to such an extent, that Lucy
declared she could not believe that he was no
more than an ordinary man.  At the end of the
summer, the absentees returned to Marcombe,
and Isabella came over to Ashcliffe in her carriage,
attended by her black Ganymede, in order to
impress her relatives duly with a sense of her
importance: herself attired in a yellow silk
brocade almost as stiff as cardboard, with an
embroidered black silk slip, and gold ornaments in
her powdered hair.  And once more Celia was
vividly reminded of Lady Ingram.
</p>

<p>
"I am going to have the black baptized," the
young lady languidly remarked.  "I shall call
him"&mdash;
</p>

<p>
"Othello," suggested Charley.
</p>

<p>
"Cassibelaunus&mdash;O Bell! do call him Cassibelaunus!"
</p>

<p>
"Nonsense, Lucy.  I shall call him Nero."
</p>

<p>
"Then he is a Christian, my dear?" asked her
mother.
</p>

<p>
"I don't think he knows anything about it,"
replied his mistress, with a short laugh.  "But you
know 'tis scarce decent to be attended by an
unbaptized black; and he will be a Christian when
'tis done."
</p>

<p>
"I am not so sure of that, Bell," said Madam
Passmore, quietly.
</p>

<p>
It was the first time that Madam Passmore had
been known to express any individual opinion upon
religious subjects.
</p>

<p>
"All baptized people are Christians," answered
Mrs. John Rowe, a little more sharply than was
respectful.
</p>

<p>
"All baptized are called Christians," corrected
her mother.  "I scarce think, Bell, that if thou
hast left thy black completely untaught in matters
of religion, that pouring a little water on his face
will cause him to become suddenly learned.  And
whether it will suddenly cause anything else of a
deeper nature may be to be questioned."
</p>

<p>
Celia listened with the greater interest because
the tone of Madam Passmore's observations was
alike unexpected and unprecedented.
</p>

<p>
"But, Mother," said Isabella, a little more
deferentially as well as reverently, "the Holy Ghost is
always given in baptism?"
</p>

<p>
"I was taught so, my dear.  But I am come to
feel unsure that God's Word saith the Holy Ghost
is always given in baptism.  And, Bell, I am
not sure that He was so given to all my children."
</p>

<p>
"You mean me, I suppose, Mother?" asked
Isabella, returning to her former tone.
</p>

<p>
"I fear so, my child," responded Madam Passmore,
so sadly and so tenderly that Isabella could
make no scornful answer.  "I have feared, indeed,
for months past that I have taught you all wrong.
God amend it!  Indeed, I hope He is Himself
teaching some of you.  But I did not mean thee
only, Bell.  I have as much fear for all of you,
except Celia, and, perhaps, Harry.  Have we feared
God, child, as a family?  Hath there not been
mere form and habit even in our devotions?  Have
we not shown much unevenness, and walked
unequally?  Have we cared to serve or please
Him at all?  Ah, my children! these are grave
questions, and I take bitter shame to myself to
have lived as many years as I have, and never
thought of them.  God forgive you&mdash;and me!"
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
"Aye, to be sure, my dear!" said old Cicely
upstairs, afterwards.  "To be sure, Madam, she's
a-coming home to the Lord.  I see her reading the
Book at odd times like, making a bit of a secret of
it, very soon after you went; and by and bye, a
little afore you came back, she came to make no
secret of it; and since then I've seen many a little
thing as showed me plain where she was a-going.
And Master Harry, my dear, he reads the Book
too&mdash;he does, for sure!  Can't say nothing about
Master, worse luck!  Then Miss Lucy and Master
Charley, you see, they're young things as hasn't
got no thought of nothing.  But as for Mrs. Bell"&mdash;
</p>

<p>
Celia quite understood, without another word.
"O Cicely!" she said, many thoughts crowding on
her mind, "surely I shall never distrust God
again!"
</p>

<p>
"But you will, Madam," said Patient, looking up
from her work.  "Aye, many and many a time!
'Tis a lesson, trust me, that neither you nor I have
learned yet.  We are such poor scholars, for ever
forgetting that though this very lesson be God's
a-b ab, for us, we need many a rod to our backs
ere we can spell it over.  Aye, Madam, you'll not
be out of school for a while yet."
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
"Celia," asked Madam Passmore that evening,
"when do you expect your brother, my dear?"
</p>

<p>
"I don't know, indeed, Mother," replied Celia.
"I expected him ere now.  I know not what is
keeping him.  Surely he will be here before
summer!"
</p>

<p>
Edward Ingram was not at Ashcliffe before summer.
</p>

<p>
The summer passed, and he did not come.  The
winter passed, and he did not come.  Nay, the
whole spring, and summer, and autumn, and
winter of another year passed, and the third
summer, of 1714, was fading into autumn&mdash;still
Edward did not come.
</p>

<p>
But when the dusk was gathering on the 5th of
August in that year, a horseman galloped into
Ashcliffe village with news which he was carrying
post-haste to Tavistock and Launceston&mdash;news
which blanched in my a cheek and set many a man
looking to his aims&mdash;which called forth muffled
peals from the church-towers, and draped pulpits
and pews in mourning, and was received with
sadness and alarm in well-nigh every English home.
For the one thread was snapped on which
England's peace had hung&mdash;the one barrier standing
between England and anarchy was broken.  The
last Stuart whom the nation acknowledged lay
dead in Kensington Palace.
</p>

<p>
So long as Queen Anne lived, the embers of
discord had been only smouldering.  The Jacobites
felt a half-satisfaction in the thought that the old
line still held the sceptre; the Whigs rejoiced in
their Whig and Protestant Queen.  Not that the
private political views of the Queen were very
Whiggish ones.  On the contrary, granted one
thing&mdash;her own personal rule&mdash;she was at heart a
Tory.  For all the years of her reign she had been
growing more and more a Tory.  She would never
have abdicated the sceptre; but very little indeed
was wanted to make her say, when the cold grasp
of the Angel of Death was laid upon her, "Let my
brother succeed me."  Such a speech would have
given the Jacobites immense vantage-ground.  For
in 1714 the State was still the Sovereign, and "<i>La
Royne le veut</i>" was sterling yet in England.  This
the partisans of the exiled family knew well; and
to their very utmost, through their trusted agents,
of whom Abigail Lady Masham was the chief, they
strove to induce the Queen to utter such words.
Her decease now was the signal for the division of
the country into two sharply-defined parties.  The
Tories strove for King James, triennial Parliaments,
removal of Popish disabilities, peace with
France, free trade, and repeal of the union with
Scotland.  The Whigs battled as fiercely for King
George, septennial Parliaments, Test and Corporation
Acts, war with France, protection, and
centralization.
</p>

<p>
A dreadful struggle was expected between these
two parties before George Louis, Elector of
Hanover, could seat himself on Anne Stuart's
vacant throne.  His character and antecedents
were much against him.  All who knew him
personally were aware that he was a man of little
intellect, and less morality.  Moreover, from both
demoralized parties there was a cry for money, and
hands were eagerly stretched out to the Elector,
less for the purpose of welcoming him than for the
hope of what he might put into them.  George
Louis gave not a stiver.  He had not many stivers
to give; but what he had he loved too well to part
with them either to Whigs or Tories.  He sat
quietly at Hanover, waiting for Parliament to vote
him supplies, and for his disinterested supporters
to secure his unopposed landing.  Parliament&mdash;from
a Whig point of view&mdash;did their duty, and
voted liberal aids within a week or two after the
Queen's death.  James was up and doing at
St. Germains, while George slumbered in his arm-chair
at Herrenhausen.  At length, on the 18th of
September, the gentleman of doubtful, or rather
undoubtful, morals, who was facetiously styled the
Hope of England, condescended to land upon our
shores.  He formed his Cabinet, allowed himself
to be crowned, dissolved Parliament, and leaving
the country to take care of itself, returned to
silence and tumblers of Hock.
</p>

<p>
The English people in the main were irreparably
disgusted with the man of their choice.  They
were ready to welcome the grandson of their
"Queen of Hearts," Elizabeth of Bohemia, but
they looked for a royal Prince, a true Stuart,
graceful and gracious.  And here was a little
stupid-looking man, who cared nothing about them,
and was a stranger alike to their language, their
customs, their manners, and their politics.  A new
edition of Charles II.'s vices, deprived of all
Charles II.'s graces&mdash;this was their chosen King.
Neither Celtic Cornwall nor Saxon Lancashire
could bear the disappointment.  West and North
rose in insurrection.  There were riots throughout
England, and many a Dissenting chapel was
levelled by the mob.  The Riot Act was made
perpetual, the Habeas Corpus Act suspended; a
price of £100,000 was set upon the head of King
James's exiled son; and his Hanoverian Majesty,
meeting his Parliament on the 21st of September
1715, civilly requested the arrest of six Tory
members of the House of Commons.
</p>

<p>
While all this was doing in England, in a quiet
corner of Scotland a little cloud was rising, which
had increased to goodly proportions by the 6th of
September, when Lord Mar unfurled in Braemar
the standard of King James the Third.  On the
13th of November were fought the battles of
Sheriffmuir and Prestonpans; and on the 22nd of
December, a little group of seven men landed at
Peterhead, one of whom was the royal exile, now
generally known as the Chevalier de St. George.
On the 7th of January 1716, he reached the
ancient Palace of his forefathers at Scone; but by
the 30th his cause was lost, and he retreated on
Montrose, whence, on the 4th of February, quitting
his native land, he returned to France.
</p>

<p>
The vengeance taken was terrible.  Head after
head fell upon the scaffold, and the throne of the
House of Hanover was established only in a sea of
blood.
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
On the evening of the 8th of March, the family
at Ashcliffe were gathered in the parlor.  The
Squire was playing draughts with Harry, the
ladies working, and Charley and Lucy engaged in
the mutual construction of an elaborate work of art.
</p>

<p>
"Sea-coal any cheaper yet, Mother?" asked the Squire.
</p>

<p>
"Not yet," said Madam Passmore.
</p>

<p>
"Monstrous dear, is it not?" inquired Harry.
</p>

<p>
"Nothing to what it was in my young days,"
answered his father.  "Forty or fifty years ago,
at the time of the Dutch war, charcoals went up
to one hundred and ten shillings the chaldron,
and those were lucky who could get them even at
that price."
</p>

<p>
"Was not that about the time of the Great Plague?"
</p>

<p>
"Yes&mdash;two or three years later."
</p>

<p>
"Then you remember the Plague, Father?"
</p>

<p>
"Remember it!" said the Squire, leaning back
in his chair and neglecting his draughts.  "Men
don't forget such a thing as that in a hurry, my
lad.  Aye, I remember it."
</p>

<p>
"But there was no plague here, was there?"
</p>

<p>
"Not just in this village; but well-nigh all
communication was stopped between Tavistock
and Exeter, and in the King's highway the grass
was growing.  It was awful at Tavistock.  The
town was shut up and declared in a state of siege,
and none allowed to approach nearer than three
miles.  Watchmen were appointed, the only men
permitted to hold communication with the
infected town; and when any provisions were
needed, they made proclamation, and the neighboring
villages brought such things as they asked to the
high ground above Merrivale Bridge, where the
cordon was drawn."
</p>

<p>
"And how did they pay for their provisions?"
</p>

<p>
"A pitful of vinegar was dug there, in some
hole in Dartmoor,[<a id="chap12fn4text"></a><a href="#chap12fn4">4</a>] and the money dropped into
it.  None in healthy places were allowed to touch
money coming from infected places without that
provision."
</p>

<p>
"Surely money could not carry the infection?"
</p>

<p>
"Money! aye, or anything else.  You have
scarce a notion how little would carry it.  Harry,
lad, throw another log on the fire; 'tis mightily
cold."
</p>

<p>
Harry obeyed orders, resumed his seat, and the
game between him and his father proceeded for a
few minutes in silence.
</p>

<p>
"Hark!" cried Madam Passmore, suddenly,
"what was that?"
</p>

<p>
"I heard nothing," said Lucy.
</p>

<p>
"What was it, Mother?" asked Harry, looking up.
</p>

<p>
"Some strange sound, as if one were about on
the terrace," she answered in a suppressed voice.
"There again!  I am sure I hear a footstep on
the gravel."
</p>

<p>
Charley rushed to the window, and endeavored
to see through the darkness.
</p>

<p>
"'Tis as dark as pitch; I can see nothing at
all!" observed that young gentleman.
</p>

<p>
"I will go out and see what it is," said Harry
rising.
</p>

<p>
He took his sword from where it lay, and left
the room.
</p>

<p>
"Bow-wow-wow-wow-wow!" said Venus, running
after him, as her contribution to the family
excitement.
</p>

<p>
Harry opened the front door, desiring Charley
to guard it till his return, and Venus, after sniffing
under it, rushed out of the house with him,
barking loudly on the terrace, in a state of great
perturbation.  Harry came back after an absence
of twenty minutes, during which the Squire had
several times "wondered what on earth was
keeping the boy."
</p>

<p>
"All right," he said, laying down his sword;
"there are no robbers about."
</p>

<p>
"It has taken you a precious time to find it
out," growled his father.
</p>

<p>
Harry sat down again to his game.  "I walked
round the terrace to make sure," he said.
</p>

<p>
"Which you might have done in five minutes,"
grumbled the Squire again.  "Now then, 'tis
your move."
</p>

<p>
Harry placed one of his three kings in dangerous
proximity to his adversary's forces.
</p>

<p>
"Thank you, Sir," said his father, satirically,
capturing the imperilled potentate.
</p>

<p>
Harry tried to retrieve himself, and succeeded
in placing the second king in the same position.
</p>

<p>
"Harry, lad, what has come to you?" asked
the Squire, looking at him.  "You were playing
better than usual till just now, but your walk round
the terrace seems to have destroyed your skill."
</p>

<p>
"I beg your pardon, Sir," answered Harry,
uncomfortably.  "I will endeavor to play better."
</p>

<p>
And he carried out his attempt by placing in
imminent peril his last remaining piece.
</p>

<p>
"Nay, nay," said his father, leaning back in his
chair, "'tis no use going on, lad.  Did you see
a ghost on the terrace?"
</p>

<p>
"I did not, Sir, I assure you," returned Harry.
</p>

<p>
"Well, I wonder what is the matter with you,"
said the Squire.  "Here, Lucy, come and let me
see if you can do any better."
</p>

<p>
Lucy took her brother's vacated seat.
</p>

<p>
"Celia," said Harry, a quarter of an hour afterwards,
turning to her, "would you mind bringing
your needle and thread up-stairs?  I want you to
help me with something which I cannot well bring
here."
</p>

<p>
"Oh yes, Harry, I will come with you," answered
Celia, re-threading her needle, and following
Harry out of the room with it in her hand.
</p>

<p>
Harry led her up-stairs, motioned her into her
own room, and, much to her surprise, locked the
door, and pocketed the key.
</p>

<p>
"Harry, something is the matter," she said.
</p>

<p>
"Something <i>is</i> the matter, Celia," repeated
Harry.  "I have brought you here to tell it
you."
</p>

<p>
"What did you see on the terrace?" she asked,
fearfully.
</p>

<p>
"Sir Edward Ingram," was the answer.
</p>

<p>
"Harry! where is he? why did you not tell me?"
</p>

<p>
"Nobody must know, Celia, except you and
me&mdash;and, perhaps, Patient.  But I would rather
not tell even her if we can avoid it.  Sir Edward
is in hiding, having fled from Sheriffmuir, and a
party of men have been riding him down, he
says, since last night.  They know he is
somewhere in the neighborhood, and will most likely
be here to search the house in an hour or less.  I
will readily risk my life for the man who saved it
at Denain; and I know his sister will help me."
</p>

<p>
"But where can we hide him?" faltered Celia.
</p>

<p>
"Here," was Harry's short answer, opening the
closet-door.
</p>

<p>
"In the closet?  O Harry! that is not safe
enough.  They would find him in a minute."
</p>

<p>
"My dear little Celia, you don't know half the
secrets of your own chamber.  Look!"
</p>

<p>
A touch of the secret spring caused the panel-door
to spring outward, and Celia's eyes to open
very wide indeed.
</p>

<p>
"I never knew there was such a place!" she cried.
</p>

<p>
"I believe no one knows but myself, and now,
you.  I discovered this room five years ago, but I
did not wish to alarm you, for I had reason to
believe it was then inhabited.  'Tis one of the old
priests' hiding-holes.  Now, watch how the door
is opened, and then contrive as best you can to
procure food for Sir Edward.  He says he is
well-nigh famished.  While you are with him, I will go
to the outlet, where a passage leads to the garden,
and remove the logs which I put at the door five
years since, as silently as I can.  Make haste,
every minute may be priceless."
</p>

<p>
Celia ran down-stairs, feeling utterly bewildered
by the position in which she was suddenly placed.
Entering the larder, she possessed herself hastily of
a large loaf and a jug of milk,&mdash;making some
excuse&mdash;she scarcely knew what&mdash;to Patient, whom
she found there; and discovered Harry and a
lamp waiting for her at the closet-door.  He had
some carpenter's tools in the other hand.  A
hurried greeting was exchanged between Edward and
Celia, who conversed in whispers until Harry
returned, announcing that the passage was now open
to the garden, and that, to avoid suspicion, both
had better go down again to the parlor.
</p>

<p>
"You must talk in the night," he said.
</p>

<p>
Harry and Celia went back to the parlor.  The
latter sat down to her work, hardly seeing a stitch
she set.  They had not been down-stairs many
minutes, when Lucy sprang up, triumphantly
exclaiming that she had won the game; at the same
moment the sound of horses' feet was audible
outside, and a loud attack was made on the great bell
which hung in front of the house.
</p>

<p>
"Open to His Majesty's troops!"
</p>

<p>
The cry could be distinctly heard in the parlor.
</p>

<p>
"Goodness me!" gasped Madam Passmore,
dropping her work in terror.
</p>

<p>
The Squire had recourse to stronger language
than this.  Harry, whose composure seemed quite
restored, went to the door and opened it with
every appearance of haste.
</p>

<p>
"Oh!" said he, in a cordial tone, "how do you
do, Wallace?  Pray come in, my father will have
infinite pleasure in making your acquaintance.
Father, here is an old comrade of mine."
</p>

<p>
"Your servant, Mr. Passmore," said Captain
Wallace, bowing, with his hat in his hand; "yours,
ladies.  I am very sorry for the ill errand I come
on.  There is a Jacobite hiding in this neighborhood,
a Colonel in the rebel army, and a man of
rank and influence&mdash;one Sir Edward Ingram.  I am
in charge to search all the houses hereabouts, and
I am sure you will not take it ill of me if I ask
leave not to omit yours, though the loyalty of
Mr. Passmore of Ashcliffe must ever be above suspicion."
</p>

<p>
"Jacobites be hanged!" burst from the Squire.
"Sir, you do me great honor.  No Jacobites in my
house&mdash;at least not if I know it.  Pray search
every corner, and cut all the cushions open if you
like!"
</p>

<p>
"Thank you, Mr. Passmore.  Only what I
expected from a gentleman of your high character.
I may begin at once?"
</p>

<p>
"By all means!"
</p>

<p>
Captain Wallace called in one of his men&mdash;leaving
the others to guard the house outside&mdash;and
after an examination of the parlor, they proceeded
up-stairs, Harry loyally volunteering to light them.
In about an hour they returned to the parlor.
</p>

<p>
"Mr. Passmore," said Captain Wallace, "'tis my
duty to question every person in the house, to
make sure that this rebel has not been seen nor
heard of.  You do not object?  A form, you
know&mdash;in such a case as this, a mere form."
</p>

<p>
"Question away," said the Squire; "<i>I</i> have neither
seen nor heard of him, and don't want to do
either.  Now for the ladies."
</p>

<p>
Madam Passmore answered the question with
a quiet negative.
</p>

<p>
"It can scarcely be necessary to trouble the
young ladies," gallantly remarked the Captain.
"But if they please to say just a word"&mdash;
</p>

<p>
"We have seen and heard nothing at all, Sir,"
said Lucy, innocently replying for both; and the
Captain did not repeat his question, neither he nor
the Squire apparently noticing the suspicious
silence of the elder sister.
</p>

<p>
"I must, if you please, ask leave to examine the
servants."
</p>

<p>
Madam Passmore rang the bell, and ordered all
the household up.  They assembled in wonder,
and each in turn responded to the Captain's queries
by a simple denial of any knowledge on the
subject.  Patient stood last, and when Captain Wallace
came to her, he accidentally put his first question
in a different form from before.
</p>

<p>
"Do you know Sir Edward Ingram?"
</p>

<p>
"Ay do I," said she.
</p>

<p>
Celia listened with a beating heart.  The
innocent ignorance of Patient might work them
terrible harm, which she would be the last person in
the world to do wittingly.
</p>

<p>
"You know him?" repeated the Captain, in surprise.
</p>

<p>
"Do you think I shouldna ken the bairn I nursed?"
</p>

<p>
"Oh! you are his nurse, are you?"
</p>

<p>
"I was so, twenty-five years back."
</p>

<p>
"When did you see him last?"
</p>

<p>
"Four years past."
</p>

<p>
"Where?"
</p>

<p>
"At Havre, in France."
</p>

<p>
Celia breathed more freely
</p>

<p>
"Have you heard anything of his movements of late?"
</p>

<p>
"What do you mean?" inquired Patient, cautiously.
</p>

<p>
"Well, did you hear that he was likely to come
into this neighborhood, or anything of that
sort?"
</p>

<p>
"I cannot say I havena heard that," was the
quiet answer.
</p>

<p>
"When did you hear that?"
</p>

<p>
"He was expecting to come four years past, but
he didna come; and I heard a short space back
that he might be looked for afore long."  Patient
spoke slowly and thoughtfully.
</p>

<p>
"Who told you that?"
</p>

<p>
"My kinsman, Willie M'Intyre."
</p>

<p>
"Are you a Scots woman?"
</p>

<p>
"Ay," said Patient, with a flash of light in her
eyes.
</p>

<p>
"Humph!" muttered the Captain.  "Difficult
folks those mostly to get round.  When did you
see Willie M'Intyre?"
</p>

<p>
"An eight days or two since."
</p>

<p>
"Cannot you tell me the day?"
</p>

<p>
"I dinna keep a diary book," responded Patient,
dryly.
</p>

<p>
"Whence had he come?"
</p>

<p>
"Whence should he come but from Scotland?"
</p>

<p>
"Where was he going?"
</p>

<p>
"I didna ask him."
</p>

<p>
Patient's information appeared to have collapsed
all at once, and her Scotticisms to increase.
</p>

<p>
"What is Willie M'Intyre?"
</p>

<p>
"A harper."
</p>

<p>
"How long was it since he left Scotland?"
</p>

<p>
"You are a learned gentleman, Sir; ye ken
better nor me how many days it would take."
</p>

<p>
"What else did he tell you about Sir Edward
Ingram?"
</p>

<p>
"He told me he was looking unco sick when he
saw him."
</p>

<p>
"Anything more?"
</p>

<p>
"I have na mair to say, Sir, without you have."
</p>

<p>
"You are a clever woman," involuntarily admitted
the Captain, passing his hand across his forehead
as if in thought.  "Well, and when did he
tell you to expect Sir Edward?"
</p>

<p>
"He didna tell me to expect him."
</p>

<p>
"What did he say about him?"
</p>

<p>
"The twa things I've told you."
</p>

<p>
"When did he say he was coming?" asked the
Captain, impatiently.
</p>

<p>
"Afore lang."
</p>

<p>
"But <i>when</i>?"
</p>

<p>
"He didna name ony day."
</p>

<p>
Captain Wallace was no match for Patient, as
might be seen.
</p>

<p>
"Have you seen Sir Edward since you saw M'Intyre?"
</p>

<p>
"No, Sir."
</p>

<p>
"Have you heard of his being here since then?"
</p>

<p>
"Being where?"
</p>

<p>
"Anywhere in this neighborhood."
</p>

<p>
Patient's answer came slowly this time, as if she
were considering something before speaking.  But
it was, "No, Sir."
</p>

<p>
"Are you telling me the truth?" asked Captain
Wallace, knitting his brows.
</p>

<p>
"I couldna tell ye aught else," answered
Patient.  "'Tis no lawful to do evil that good may
come.  But no good will come, Sir, of your
hunting a man to death to whom Christ hath given
power to become one of the sons of God."
</p>

<p>
"Oh dear! a Puritan!" murmured Wallace&mdash;"a
Covenanter, for aught I know.  Mr. Passmore,
these are the most impracticable people you ever
meet&mdash;these Puritans; particularly when they are
Scots.  There is not much loyalty among them;
and what little there is is sacrificed to their
religion at any moment."
</p>

<p>
"I'm loyal, Sir," said Patient, softly&mdash;"to any
covenanted King: but needs be to the King of
Kings the first."
</p>

<p>
"I fear you are a dangerous character," said
Captain Wallace, severely.  "I am surprised to
meet with such an one in this house.  However,
you won't lie to me, being a Puritan&mdash;that is one
good thing.  They never tell lies.  Now listen!
Do you know where Sir Edward Ingram is at this
moment?"
</p>

<p>
The "No Sir," came readily enough this time.
</p>

<p>
"Well, I suppose you can go," said Captain
Wallace, doubtfully.  "But I am not at all
satisfied with you&mdash;mark that!  Your witness is very
badly given, and very unwillingly.  I may want
you again.  If it should be needful to search the
house a second time, I certainly shall do so.  You
have only just escaped being put under arrest
now."
</p>

<p>
"I've told you the truth, Sir," said Patient,
pausing.  "I will tell you the truth any day.
But if it were to come to this&mdash;that my dying
could save you from finding my bairn Sir Edward,
I wouldna haud my life as dear as yon bittie of
thread upon the floor!"
</p>

<p>
She courtesied and departed.
</p>

<p>
"Ah! that shows what the woman is," said
Captain Wallace, carelessly.  "An enthusiast&mdash;a
complete fanatic.  Well, Mr. Passmore"&mdash;
</p>

<p>
"Sir," said the Squire, energetically, "I am by
no means satisfied with this.  The house shall be
searched again, if you please, and I will join the
party myself.  Harry, fetch a longer candle&mdash;fetch
two!  That woman may have hidden the fellow
anywhere!  I'll have every corner looked into.
There shall be no question of any hiding of
Jacobites in my house.  Charley, go and get a candle
too.  You girls have a lot of gowns and fallals in
that closet in your room.  Go and bundle them
all out!  Make haste!"
</p>

<p>
"Oh, I say, what fun!" remarked Charley, to
whom any connection between the hunted man
and his favorite sister never occurred.
</p>

<p>
Lucy left the room laughing to execute her father's
behest, and Celia dared not but follow, lest
her absence should be remarked.  The two girls
went hastily up-stairs, and at the top they found
Patient standing.
</p>

<p>
"I'll help you, Mrs. Lucy," said she.  And as
Lucy passed on,&mdash;"You ken something, Madam
Celia.  Don't let those bloodhounds read it in
your eyes, as I do.  And be calm.  The Lord
reigneth, my bairn."
</p>

<p>
"Yes, dear Patient, I know," was Celia's faltering
answer: and she went quietly into her own
room.

LADY GRISELDA'S RUBY RING
</h3>

<p class="poem2">
  "He looketh upon us sweetly,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With His well-known greeting, 'Peace!'<br />
  And He fills our hearts completely,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the sounds of the tempest cease;<br />

<p>
Celia found Lucy already engaged in emptying
the closet.  Patient came in and helped her
until the bed was covered with cloaks and dresses.
They heard the searchers coming slowly toward
them on the other side of the passage, the Squire
especially urging that not the smallest corner
should be left unsearched.  At length they tapped
at the door for admittance.  Charley came in
first, holding his candle high above his head, as if
his mission were to explore the ceiling.
</p>

<p>
"You be off!" said the Squire roughly, as soon
as he saw Patient.
</p>

<p>
"Why, Father!" interposed Lucy, "she has
only been helping us to move these things.  You
told us to make haste."
</p>

<p>
Lucy was unconsciously proving a useful ally.
</p>

<p>
"Wow!" came in a little smothered bark from
somewhere, and Venus waddled from under the
valance and the dresses overhanging it.
</p>

<p>
"Go down, Veny!" said Celia, adding apologetically,
"she will get in the way."
</p>

<p>
She felt a terrible secret fear lest Venus should
prove a more able searcher than any other of the
party.
</p>

<p>
"I'll carry her out of the way,"&mdash;and suiting
the action to the word, Lucy caught up the little
dog and shut her outside.
</p>

<p>
A close examination was made of the room.
Charley got into the closet, and held his candle
up.
</p>

<p>
"Nothing there, thanks to the young ladies,"
said Captain Wallace, laughing, as he looked in.
</p>

<p>
"No&mdash;he'd be a clever fellow who could hide
there," added the Squire, in blissful ignorance.
</p>

<p>
"Why, here's a nail," said Charley, "close to
the wall.  You'll tear your gowns on it.  I'll pull
it out."
</p>

<p>
Celia's very heart sank.
</p>

<p>
"Leave it just now, Charley," said Harry,
coolly; "we shall want you and your candle."
</p>

<p>
Charley sprang down and rejoined the searching
party.  Outside the door they were also joined by
Venus, who followed them into the next room,
which had been the bed-chamber of Isabella.
She picked out Captain Wallace, and followed
close at his heels, paying no attention to anybody
else.  The room was searched like the others, the
last thing which the Captain did being to look up
the chimney.  No sooner did he approach the
fireplace than Venus gave an angry growl and
made a futile attempt to bite him through his
thick boots.
</p>

<p>
"What is the brute growling at?" demanded
the Squire.
</p>

<p>
"I don't know, indeed," said Harry.
</p>

<p>
The growling continued so long as Captain
Wallace was near the chimney, but nobody except
Venus knew why.  As soon as the party turned
from Isabella's room to Henrietta's, which was
the next, Venus trotted back to Celia.  At the
close of the inspection, both Captain Wallace and
Squire Passmore were forced to acknowledge that
no trace of any hidden fugitive could be
discovered.  They went down-stairs.
</p>

<p>
Five minutes later Harry came lightly up again,
and called to Celia, who was helping Lucy to
replace the dresses in the closet.  She found him in
Isabella's chamber.
</p>

<p>
"Let us look at this chimney, Celia," he said.
"It must be very near the hiding-place.  What
made Veny growl?"
</p>

<p>
He had brought a small ladder from the housemaid's
closet, with which he mounted as far as he
could go inside the wide old chimney.  When he
came down, he looked pale and excited.
</p>

<p>
"Celia, we must get him out of the house.  If
either Wallace or my father should think of
returning to see the cause of Veny's growling, he
will infallibly be discovered.  The chimneys join,
and every sound from one room can be heard in
the other.  Venus is wiser than we are.  The dog
knew, though I did not, that there was a shorter
passage to the concealed chamber from Bell's
chamber than from yours."
</p>

<p>
"What shall we do?" whispered Celia.
</p>

<p>
"Go down-stairs, and fetch from the buttery
such provisions as you can take to Sir Edward,
of any portable kind.  Converse with him if you
will, but let it be in the lowest tones; and if you
hear any noise in this chamber be as mute as
mice.  I will go down and set my father and
Wallace at some game, and get my mother to prepare
Henrietta's chamber for him, as it is too late for
him to think of leaving to-night now.  Then I
shall go and have a horse ready saddled as near
as is safe.  When the clock strikes nine, lead Sir
Edward down to the well door.  You cannot miss
it, if only you keep going down.  I will meet you
with a lantern at the well, at nine or as soon after
as possible."
</p>

<p>
"Is the well low enough, with all this rain?"
</p>

<p>
"Water up to the ankles, but he will not care
for that."
</p>

<p>
Harry and Celia left the room softly, departing
on their several errands.
</p>

<p>
"Wallace," said the former, coming into the
parlor, "do you think it is necessary to keep your
men on guard outside?  'Tis a bitter cold night,
and if they may come into the kitchen, the poor
fellows would be none the worse for a hot supper."
</p>

<p>
"I do not think it is necessary," said the Captain.
</p>

<p>
Captain Wallace having called the men in,
Harry took them to the kitchen, and desired Molly
the cook-maid to give them as good a supper as
she could, with hot ale, for which Robert was
despatched to the cellar.  This done, Harry went
up-stairs to his own room.  Silently opening his
window&mdash;which, fortunately for his project, was at
the north-east corner of the house, away from both
parlor and kitchen&mdash;he climbed down the lime-tree
which stood close beside it, and took his way
noiselessly to the stable.  Meanwhile Celia, who
had concealed in her pocket and by means of
the dressing-gown over her arm, two standing pies,
came back to her own room, and descended to the
concealed chamber.
</p>

<p>
"See what I have brought you!" she said to the
fugitive.  "The troops are here, and have searched
the house twice, and Harry thinks that we must
get you away to-night.  He will have a horse ready
for you, and will meet you at the well at nine
o'clock.  Do you mind going through a foot of
water?"
</p>

<p>
"I should be a Sybarite if I did," smiled Edward
in reply.  "Celia, I am bringing you into danger,
and I am very sorry for it.  I begin to think now
that it was but a cowardly act to seek shelter here;
yet when a man is riding for life he scarce pauses
to choose his course."
</p>

<p>
"You have brought me into no danger, dear, into
which I did not choose to be brought," she
answered.  "But if they found you, Edward, what
would they do to you?"
</p>

<p>
"What they did but a few days since on Tower
Hill to my friend Lord Derwentwater,"[<a id="chap13fn1text"></a><a href="#chap13fn1">1</a>]  he said,
gravely.
</p>

<p>
Celia shuddered as the agony and ignominy of
that horrible scaffold came up before her eyes.
</p>

<p>
"They will not do it without the Lord's permission,"
added he, quietly.  "Celia, I am in grave
doubt whether I have done right in this matter.
Not that I could ever see it right to fight against
King James, nor that I doubt which would have
been the right side to take at the time of the
Revolution.  I cannot quite see&mdash;what I know would
be Patient's view, and is the view of many good
men&mdash;that we had no right to fight for a Popish
King.  I do not judge those who thought so&mdash;to
our own Master we all stand or fall.  But I see the
matter in another light.  It was not that King
James, being a Papist, was made King out of his
turn, but that, being heir to the throne, he became
a Papist.  I see an immense difference between the
two.  God, not we, made him our King; God
made the present King James his son, knowing
that he would be brought up a Papist.  What
right had we to cast him off?  Now the case is
altered; he is cast off; and, considering the danger
of Popery, have I, <i>now</i>, any right to bring him in
again?  This is my difficulty; and if I can leave
England in safety, I do not think I shall draw my
sword in the Jacobite cause again, though I never
could take the oath of allegiance to any other
King.  I will never dare to attempt the prevention
of the Lord's will, if only I can be certain what the
Lord's will is in this matter."
</p>

<p>
"Well, I do not see the question quite as you
do.  It seems to me that they were right to cast
off a Popish King.  But we have no time to
discuss politics to-night.  You will leave England,
then, at once?"
</p>

<p>
"There is no hope of life otherwise.  The
Elector of Hanover and his Ministers can have no
mercy for us who fought at Sheriffmuir."
</p>

<p>
"And when am I likely to see you again, Edward?"
</p>

<p>
"When the Heavenly Jerusalem descendeth out
of Heaven from God," he answered, softly.
</p>

<p>
"No sooner?" responded Celia, tearfully.
</p>

<p>
"God knoweth," he said.  "How do I know?
I have a fancy sometimes&mdash;a foreboding, if you
will&mdash;that my life will not be long.  So much the
better.  Yet I do not wish to be longing selfishly
for rest ere the Lord's work for me is done.  Look
here, Celia!  Look well at this ring, so that you
will know it again in any place after any lapse of
time."
</p>

<p>
He drew the ring from his finger and passed it
to her.  It was an old-fashioned gold ring, set
with a single ruby.  Inside it was engraved in
obsolete spelling, a "posy"&mdash;
</p>

<p class="poem">
  "In thys my chance<br />
  I doe rejoyce."<br />
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
"I shall know this again," said Celia, returning
the ring after a close inspection.  "'Tis an old
jewel."
</p>

<p>
"A family heirloom," said Edward.  "Our mother
was married with that ring.  It came into out
family as the wedding-ring of Lady Grissel
Fleming, our grandmother.  I will endeavor to
contrive, dear Cicely, that by some means this ring
shall reach your hands after my death.  When you
next see it in the possession of any but myself, it
will signify to you that I have entered into my
rest."
</p>

<p>
"Edward, where is your wife?" asked Celia,
suddenly.
</p>

<p>
A spasm of pain crossed Edward's face.
</p>

<p>
"I have no wife," he said.  "The Lord had
more need of my Flora than I had, and two
summers past He said unto her, 'Come up higher.'  I
am almost glad now that she was spared this.  I
saw her but twice after I parted from you at
Havre.  And I do not think it will be long now
ere I shall see her again."
</p>

<p>
"You seem to like the prospect, Edward," said
Celia, remonstratingly.
</p>

<p>
"Have I so very much to live for, my sister?  I
can do no good to you, especially now that we
must be parted; and my sole object in life is to do
and suffer all the will of God.  Do you wonder if
I wish at times that it would be the Lord's will to
summon me home?"
</p>

<p>
There was a short pause, broken by Edward's
sudden exclamation, "Celia!"
</p>

<p>
She looked up to see what was coming.
</p>

<p>
"How long have you known of this chamber?"
</p>

<p>
"Harry said he had known of it for five years;
I never heard a word about it before to-night."
</p>

<p>
"Did he suspect that it was occupied?"
</p>

<p>
"I think he said it was, or had been, shortly
before he discovered it."
</p>

<p>
"Would you like to know by whom?"
</p>

<p>
"Very much.  Why, Edward, how do you know?"
</p>

<p>
"There is not time to explain that; but I can
tell you that Father Stevens, a Jesuit priest, was
in hiding here for some time, and for about two
months, Gilbert Irvine."
</p>

<p>
"What were they doing here? and how did they
get their provisions?"
</p>

<p>
"What Stevens was doing I cannot say; but
Gilbert's object was you.  He was sent here by my
mother to make himself acquainted with you by
sight, and to discover all he could about you and
your friends here.  As to provisions, he catered for
himself in the village and elsewhere; but on two or
three occasions, when he dared not venture out,
and was very hard bestead, he supplied himself
from Mr. Passmore's larder."
</p>

<p>
"How did he get there?"
</p>

<p>
"Through your room."
</p>

<p>
"Edward!"
</p>

<p>
"It was a bold move, and might have cost him
dear if you had awoke."
</p>

<p>
"Do you mean to say that he did it while Lucy
and I were sleeping in the room?"
</p>

<p>
"Yes," said Edward, with his grave smile.
</p>

<p>
Celia sent her memory back to the time, and a
dim vision gradually revealed itself to her of one
winter night when, awaking suddenly, she had
fancied she heard mice in the wainscot, and the next
morning the black cat had suffered at the hands
of Molly for the absence of a partridge and a cold
chicken from the buttery.
</p>

<p>
"But how came my step-mother to know
anything about this hidden chamber?"
</p>

<p>
"Through Stevens, who at one time was among
her confessors.  Oh! the priests know their old
hiding-places, though the owners may have lost
the tradition of them."
</p>

<p>
"Have you seen my Lady Ingram of late?"
</p>

<p>
"Within the last six months."
</p>

<p>
"How does she at Chaillot?"
</p>

<p>
"The nuns say she is killing herself with austerities,
and she looks as though she might be.  She
has her salvation to make, you see."
</p>

<p>
"What a dreadful delusion!" sighed Celia.
</p>

<p>
"One of man's hundred usurpations of the
prerogative of God.  If man may not save himself
wholly, he will save himself in part; he will do
anything rather than let Christ do everything.
'Tis just the world, the flesh, and the devil, in a
peculiar shape, and of a very fair color.  'Puffed
up by his fleshly mind,'[<a id="chap13fn2text"></a><a href="#chap13fn2">2</a>] saith St. Paul of this
manner of mortifying of the flesh.  The subtlest
serving of the devil lies, I think, in this kind of
renouncing of the world.  And the world, in
whatever shape, 'passeth away, and the lust thereof;
but he that doeth the will of God abideth
forever.'"[<a id="chap13fn3text"></a><a href="#chap13fn3">3</a>]
</p>

<p>
As Edward spoke the last word, the old clock in
the hall struck nine.  Both rose, and Edward,
drawing Celia to him, kissed his last farewell.
</p>

<p>
"God be brother and sister to you, dear," he
said, "and keep thee in all thy ways;[<a id="chap13fn4text"></a><a href="#chap13fn4">4</a>] set thee in
the secret place of the Most High, that thou
mayest abide under the shadow of the
Almighty.[<a id="chap13fn5text"></a><a href="#chap13fn5">5</a>]  Christ be with thee!  Amen!"
</p>

<p>
They went softly down to the door opening into
the well, outside of which was Harry with a
ladder.  There was another figure there beside
Harry's, but the moonlight was not sufficient to show
who it might be.
</p>

<p>
"Say farewell to Patient for me," said Edward.
"I wish I could have seen her.  Adieu!"
</p>

<p>
In another minute Edward was safely landed.
As soon as he touched the ground, the second
figure came forward and threw its arms round his
neck.
</p>

<p>
"Eh, my bairn! my bairn!" sobbed a voice
which both Edward and Celia knew well.  "I
could never bear to let you go but a word.  The
Lord bless thee and guide thee!  My ain bit
laddie, that I nursed!"
</p>

<p>
Edward returned the embrace very warmly.
Patient had always been far more of a mother to
him than Lady Ingram.  He seemed disposed to
hesitate for a moment, but Harry urged him away,
and motioned to Celia to return.  She left the
three on the outside of the well.  Harry and
Edward hastening to the place where the horse
waited, and Patient, silent and motionless,
watching her darling pass from her sight.
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
Celia was early down-stairs the next morning.
Harry met her in the hall, and contrived to
whisper along with his morning kiss, "All
right."  Further communication was impossible, for the
Squire was just behind them, and the three
entered the parlor together.  They found Captain
Wallace looking out of the window.
</p>

<p>
"Good-morning, Captain," said the Squire.  "I
suppose you have heard nothing of your man?"
</p>

<p>
"Nothing whatever, Mr. Passmore."
</p>

<p>
"Well, I'll have the house searched again by
daylight.  First thing after breakfast"&mdash;
</p>

<p>
"Your energy is most laudable, Mr. Passmore;
but really, after two previous searches&mdash;is it
necessary?"
</p>

<p>
"Necessary or unnecessary, it shall be done,
Sir," said the Squire, warmly.  "No man on earth
shall have the shadow of reason for suspecting any
concealment of rebels in Ashcliffe Hall.  You will
do me the favor to accompany me, and Harry and
Charley shall come too."
</p>

<p>
"I shall be most happy, Sir," responded Harry.
</p>

<p>
"'Tis splendid fun!" commented Charley.  "I
only wish we could find him!"
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
The search took place, and not a corner was left
an examined, except only the undiscovered
hiding-place, which alone needed examination.  The
Squire pressed Captain Wallace to be his guest
for another day, and so, for a different reason, did
his eldest son.  Captain Wallace accepted the
offer, after a decent show of reluctance to save his
conscience.  Harry no longer pressed him to stay
after the following morning, and he left the next
day.
</p>

<p>
"Father," said Harry, in the evening, "I fear I
am about to draw your displeasure upon me, but
I have done what I thought right, and I must bear
it.  Sir Edward Ingram left this house at nine
o'clock yesterday evening."
</p>

<p>
"Left this house!" cried the Squire and Madam
Passmore, in a breath&mdash;the former adding some
very powerful language, which shall not be
reproduced here.
</p>

<p>
"Left the house," Harry repeated, calmly.
</p>

<p>
The Squire exploded a second time, telling his
son, among other equally pleasant assertions, that
he was a disgrace to his family and his country,
and would come to the gallows before he was much
older.
</p>

<p>
"Father," was Harry's dignified reply, "I am
sorry for nothing, except that I have angered you.
This man whom Wallace was seeking is a gentleman
and a Protestant, and at the battle of Denain
he saved my life, and gave me my liberty without
ransom.  Would you, as a man of conscience and
honor, have advised me to give him up after that?"
</p>

<p>
The Squire growled something inaudible.
</p>

<p>
"Father!" said Celia, rising in her turn, very
white and trembling, "this was my brother whom
we concealed in your house last night.  I will take
half, or more than half, of whatever blame is due.
Harry concealed him, but it was in my bed-chamber,
and I brought him food, and assisted in his escape.
Could I have delivered up my brother to death&mdash;the
only brother I have left?  Father, have you
the heart to say so?"
</p>

<p>
"No, my dear!" said Madam Passmore, pouring
a little oil upon the turbulent waters; "no, I am
sure he never would&mdash;never!"
</p>

<p>
Madam Passmore's gentle deprecation of his
wrath appeared to set the Squire free to explode a
third time.
</p>

<p>
"Lucy!" he exclaimed, turning to his wife, in
one of the severest tones he had ever used to her,
"I am a Whig, and my father was a Whig before
me, and my grandfather fought for King Charles
at Edgehill and Naseby: and I have brought up
these children to be Whigs, and if they aren't, 'tis
a burning shame!  A murrain on the day that sent
my Lady Ingram here after our Celia!  But, hang
it all! how can I help it?" said the Squire,
suddenly breaking down.  "If this fellow be Celia's
brother, and have saved Harry's life, as a man of
honor I could not bid them do otherwise than try
to save his&mdash;no, not if he were the Pope himself!
'Tis not nature for a man to take sides against his
own children.  Botheration!" he concluded,
suddenly veering round again; "that isn't what I
meant to say at all.  I intended to be very angry,
and I have only been an old fool&mdash;that's what I am!"
</p>

<p>
"You are a dear old father, who can't be cross
when he thinks he ought to be&mdash;that's what you
are!" said Lucy, coaxingly.
</p>

<p>
"Get along with you, hussey!" returned the
Squire, shaking his fist at her in a manner which
Lucy very well knew was more than half
make-believe.  "And pray, Colonel Passmore, after
allowing me to search the house three times and
find nothing, I should like, if you please, to know
where you hid your refugee?"
</p>

<p>
"You shall see that, Father," said Harry, rising.
</p>

<p>
And he led the way to the hiding-place, followed
by the whole family, Cicely bringing up the rear
when she heard the noise they made.  Each
member expressed his or her amazement in a
characteristic manner.
</p>

<p>
"Oh, my buttons! isn't that capital!" said
Charley.  "I wish I had known last night!  It
would have been ten times better fun!"
</p>

<p>
"I think you enjoyed yourself sufficiently,"
returned his brother, gravely.
</p>

<p>
"What a horrid, dark hole, Harry!" said Lucy.
</p>

<p>
"I never knew of such a place here!" exclaimed
his mother.
</p>

<p>
"Well, Mr. Henry Falkland Passmore, you are
an uncommon cool hand!" asserted his father.
"And who helped you to get your Jacobite safely
away, I wonder?"
</p>

<p>
"Celia and Patient Irvine."
</p>

<p>
"Did Patient know where he was, Harry?"
asked his mother, gravely.
</p>

<p>
"Not when Wallace questioned her.  I told her
afterwards."
</p>

<p>
But the astonishment of the whole group faded
before that of old Cicely Aggett.
</p>

<p>
"Well, I do declare!" was what she said.  "If
ever anybody did!  No, nobody couldn't never
have guessed the like of this&mdash;that they couldn't!
I've lived in this house three-and-thirty years come
Martlemas, and I never, never did see nor hear
nothing this like in all my born days!  Only just
to think!  And them things I took for rats and
ghosteses was Papishes?  Eh, but I'd a cruel deal
rather have a hundred rats and mice nor one of
them wicked Papishes, and ghosteses too, pretty
nigh!  Well, to be sure, my dears, the Lord has
preserved us wonderful! and 'tis uncommon
thankful we'd ought to be."
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
"You will sleep to-night, Madam, I trust," said
Patient, that evening, as she bound up Celia's
hair.
</p>

<p>
"And you, my poor Patient!" said Celia.  "I
fear you slept not much last night."
</p>

<p>
"No, Madam," answered Patient, quietly; "I
watched unto prayer."
</p>

<p>
"Well, I hope Edward is quite safe by this time,"
sighed Celia.
</p>

<p>
"You will never see him again, Madam," said
Patient, solemnly.
</p>

<p>
"Patient!" exclaimed Celia, in sudden terror lest
she might have heard some bad news.
</p>

<p>
"Best, my bairn," said Patient, reading her
thought in her face.  "I have heard nothing.
But 'tis borne in upon me&mdash;'tis borne in upon me.
The Lord hath said unto me, 'He shall surely die.'"
</p>

<p>
Celia listened in awe and wonder.  "Patient, you
are not a prophetess!" she said.
</p>

<p>
"Ah, Madam!  I think more than one of us hath
been a prophet where our heart's beloved are
concerned.  Was it not revealed unto Alexander
Peden that he should die in Scotland?  And did
he not say unto the captain of the ship appointed
to carry him unto the American plantations, 'The
ship is not launched that shall carry me thither?'"
</p>

<p>
"And where did he die?"
</p>

<p>
"In Scotland, Madam, as the Lord had showed
him; and they laid his dust on the Gallows' Hill
of the city.  I reckon the Lord can see it as easily
there as in the kirkyard.  It is a kirkyard now.
One after another came and laid their dead beside
Peden, and from a gallows' hill 'tis become a
burying-place.[<a id="chap13fn6text"></a><a href="#chap13fn6">6</a>]  It was said, indeed, that Mr. Renwick
saw further than many, but he was not known unto
me, and I can say nought thereanent.  But that,
'The secret of the Lord is with them that fear
Him'[<a id="chap13fn7text"></a><a href="#chap13fn7">7</a>] may be a deeper word than we ken.  And
as to George Wishart, all knew that he was called
to be a prophet of the Lord, and John Knox likewise;
but there were giants in their days.  We be
smaller men now.  Yet the Lord is the same now
as then, and He doeth whatsoever He will.  'Tis
not the worthiness nor holiness of the man that
maketh a prophet, but the breath and Spirit of the
Lord within him.  And I, being less than the least
of all His, do know of a surety that I shall never
see Master Edward any more."
</p>

<p>
Patient's lips quivered, and some seconds passed
ere she could speak again.
</p>

<p>
"Ay, the will of the Lord be done!" she said,
presently.  "'He knoweth them that are His,'[<a id="chap13fn8text"></a><a href="#chap13fn8">8</a>]
and He will not let us fail of a meeting in our
Father's house.  Rest, my bairn; you need it!"
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
Two months afterwards came a letter to Squire
Passmore, bearing neither date nor signature.
Though Edward's hand was unknown to her, Celia
claimed the precious paper at once.
</p>

<p>
"DEAR SISTER,&mdash;Last night I landed at Corunna.
I shall be safe for the present, and the Lord is
ever with me.  Thank better than I could all who
helped me.  You will know from whom this comes.
Love to both of you.  God keep you!"
</p>

<p>
Celia carried the paper to Patient, whom she
guessed to be included with herself in the "both of
you."
</p>

<p>
"Thank you, Madam!" said Patient, when she
had read it.  "'Tis a comfort to hear that he is in
safety.  Yet I cannot forget that the Lord hath
showed unto me that he shall die in the flower of
his age."
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
The 5th of June 1721, was Celia's thirtieth
birth-day.  She was seated at work in the parlor
with Madam Passmore and Lucy, when a ring at
the great bell summoned Robert to the front door,
and was followed by his announcement of
"Mr. Colville."  Celia looked up in surprise to see if
Philip's friend had sought her out.  No; this was
certainly not her pantheist adversary.  He was a
smaller and slighter man, with a much pleasanter
expression of face than his namesake, yet with the
same pale blue eyes and flaxen hair, and some
resemblance in the features.
</p>

<p>
"Mrs. Ingram?" he asked, a little doubtfully,
with a smile and a low bow.  "Mrs. Celia Ingram?"
</p>

<p>
Celia rose to receive him, wondering all the time
who he was and what he wanted with her.
</p>

<p>
"That is my name, Sir," she said, a little timidly.
"I once knew a Mr. Colville in Paris"&mdash;
</p>

<p>
"Who was my brother," said the visitor, in
explanation.  "It was Arthur Colville whom you
met in Paris.  I am David Colville.  I have been
commissioned to give something into your hands,
and none other's, the signification of which I
believe you know.  I received it at Barcelona on the
18th of January last."
</p>

<p>
And he drew a pocket-book from his breast-pocket,
out of which he took and held forward to
Celia something which brought a pang to her
heart and a cry of pain to her lips.  It was the
Ingram heirloom, Lady Griselda's ruby ring, which
was to be the signal to Edward Ingram's sister
that he had entered into his rest.
</p>

<p>
"When was this?" she faltered at last.
</p>

<p>
"At Barcelona, on the 18th of January," David
Colville repeated.  "I had met him, for I also was
journeying in Spain, three weeks before.  I saw
the end was near, and I stayed with him and
tended him till he died."
</p>

<p>
"Where is he buried?"
</p>

<p>
"The Spaniards allow no burial to heretics,
Madam&mdash;not more than they allow to a horse or a
dog.  He lies in a quiet meadow near the inn at
Barcelona.  I took care of that."
</p>

<p>
"Thank you!" murmured Celia; "but no
burial-service&mdash;O Edward!"
</p>

<p>
The soft answer from David Colville almost
startled her&mdash;"'Thy brother shall rise again.'"[<a id="chap13fn9text"></a><a href="#chap13fn9">9</a>]
</p>

<p>
"Yes, I know," she said.  "And you, Mr. Colville&mdash;you
do not share your brother's philosophical views?"
</p>

<p>
"God forbid!" was the uncompromising reply.
"I have yet hope that Arthur may see the error
of his ways."
</p>

<p>
"May I ask if Mr. Arthur Colville is well?"
</p>

<p>
"I have not seen him for many years," said
David.  "Madam, may I ask, in my turn, if Patient
Irvine be yet here?  I think she would remember
me as an old playmate of Ned and Philip, in the
days long ago when we were all boys at Paris."
</p>

<p>
Patient received David Colville very affectionately,
and his news very quietly.
</p>

<p>
"I knew it would be so," she said.  "'With
Christ, which is far better.'"[<a id="chap13fn10text"></a><a href="#chap13fn10">10</a>]
</p>

<p>
David Colville left an agreeable impression of
himself on the minds of both Celia and Patient
when he shook hands with them at parting.
</p>

<p>
There was sore mourning for Edward Ingram at
Ashcliffe.
</p>

<p>
"If it would please the Lord to ask me also!"
sighed Patient.
</p>

<p>
"No, dear Patient!  I want you," said Celia,
lovingly.
</p>

<p>
"So long as you really want me, Madam, I shall
be kept here; but the Lord knoweth better than
you what you need, and our work is done when He
calleth us.  Yet so much, there!  My father, my
mother, Roswith, Mr. Grey, and Lady Magdalene,
and Mr. Philip, and now my ain bairn Maister
Edward"&mdash;and Patient broke down.
</p>

<p>
"Now, Patient, my dear!" said Cicely, from her
chair, for she was infirm now&mdash;"now Patient, my
dear, don't you go to fret over the Lord's mercies.
Can't you see, child, that He is but taking all your
jewels to keep them safer than you can, and that
He'll give them all back to you up yonder?  'Tis
such a short time here&mdash;such a short time!"
</p>

<p>
"Ay, I ken that," said Patient; "but you're a
deal further on than I am, Cicely."
</p>

<p>
"Why, my dear, if you mean I shall die sooner,
I don't know who told you; and if you mean that
I know more about the Lord than you, I'm sure 'tis
the first time I've heard of it.  Maybe, children, we
can't tell which of us is the furthest&mdash;the Lord
knows.  The one nearest Him is the furthest on."
</p>

<p>
"And we are always straying from Him," said
Celia, sighing.  "It scarce seems in us to keep
always near Him."
</p>

<p>
"When you were a little babe, my dear," said
Cicely, "I remember, if you were frighted at aught,
you used to make-believe to throw your bits of arms
about my neck, and cling close to me; but after
all, it warn't your clinging as kept you from falling,
but me holding of you.  We are all as babes in the
Lord's arms, my clear.  'Tis well, surely, for us to
keep clinging to Him; but, after all, it ben't that as
holds us&mdash;'tis His keeping of us.  It ben't always
when we are looking at Him that He is closest to
us.  He may be nearest when we can't see Him;
and I'm sure of one thing, child,&mdash;if the Good Shepherd
didn't go a-seeking after the lost sheep, the lost
sheep would never turn of itself and come home to
the Good Shepherd;&mdash;it would only go farther and
farther in the great wilderness, until it was wholly
lost.  'He calleth His own sheep by name'&mdash;ben't
that it?&mdash;'and leadeth them out.'[<a id="chap13fn11text"></a><a href="#chap13fn11">11</a>]  Deary
me! what was we a-talking about?  It seems so
natural like to get round to Him."
</p>

<p>
Celia smiled sadly as Philip's remark occurred
to her&mdash;"There you come round to your divinity!"
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
For eleven years longer George Louis of Hanover
sat on the throne of England.  Every year he
sank lower and lower in the estimation of his
subjects.  When he first landed, in 1714, in tones
more deep than loud, England had demanded her
Queen, and had no answer.  Now, through these
thirteen years, she had seen her King, chosen out
of all the Princes of Europe, living apart from
every member of his family, and keeping up a
Court which only the complete demoralization of
her nobles made them not ashamed to visit.  And
though very dimly and uncertainly, yet reports
did reach England of a guarded prison in Hanover,
and of a chapel in it where, every Communion
Sabbath, a white-robed prisoner knelt down
before the holy table, and, laying her hand upon it,
solemnly protested in the presence of God that she
had done no wrong deserving of that penalty.
And England began to wonder if she had spoken
well in summoning to her helm the husband and
gaoler of this woful, white-robed captive.  If the
grand question of Protestantism had not been at
stake&mdash;if she could have retained that and yet
have had back her old line&mdash;the throne of George
Louis would have trembled and fallen under him.
Not "The Fifteen," nor "The Forty-five," brought
so near a second Restoration as the evil and
miserable life of that crowned sinner from
Hanover.
</p>

<p>
So early as 1716, George had persuaded Parliament
to repeal that clause of the Act of Settlement
which made obligatory the perpetual residence of
the Sovereign: and no sooner had the clerk[<a id="chap13fn12text"></a><a href="#chap13fn12">12</a>] said
<i>Le Roy le veut</i> to the repeal, than George set out
for Hanover, with extreme delight at his release.
After that, he spent as little time in England as
was possible.
</p>

<p>
On the 7th of June 1727, George Louis landed
from England on the Dutch shores.  He was
travelling onwards towards Osnabrück, when, on
the night of the 11th, an unknown hand threw a
letter into his carriage.  The King, who was alone,
opened it in the expectation of seeing a petition.
There were only a few lines in the letter, but they
came from the dead, and were written as with fire.
What met his eyes was a summons from Sophia
Dorothea of Zelle, written on her death-bed in the
preceding November at Ahlden, calling on him in
God's name to meet her before His tribunal within
a year and a day.  The King was intensely
superstitious.  What more happened in that carriage
where he sat solitary, holding in his hand the open
letter from his dead wife, none ever knew: but
when the carriage stopped at the gates of the
Palace of Osnabrück, George Louis was dead.
</p>

<p>
There were no mourners.  Least of all could
England mourn for the man who had so bitterly
disgraced her, and had made her feel ashamed of
her choice before all the world.  On the contrary,
there were bonfires and bell-ringings and universal
rejoicings for the accession of George Augustus,
whom England welcomed with hope in her heart
that he would restore the honor which his father
had laid in the dust.
</p>

<p>
A vain hope, and a groundless joy.
</p>

<p>
It is on that summer day, the 11th of June
1727, that I take leave of the Passmores.  A quiet
family party&mdash;Lucy growing into another and a
livelier Celia; Charley toning down into a second
Harry; Isabella, when she condescends to shine
upon Ashcliffe in her glories of carriage and Nero,
being the only discordant element.  She and
John Rowe get on very well, by reason of the
lady being mistress, and John her obedient
servant.  Squire and Madam Passmore have grown
more white and infirm; and on one quiet summer
night in the preceding year, without sound or
forewarning, the angels of God came down from
heaven to bear Cicely Aggett home to the Father's
house.  But Patient lives on, for her work is not
yet over.
</p>

<p>
On that afternoon Celia and Harry had rung
the bell at the gate of Sainte Marie de Chaillot,
and had asked for an interview with Soeur Marie
Angélique.  And in the guest-chamber there came
to them a pale, slender, worn-looking woman in a
nun's garb, who assured them, as she had done
before on several occasions, that she was making
her salvation; that she trusted she had by this
time nearly expiated all her sins, and that a very
short time in Purgatory would suffice to purify
her.  Only once during the interview did her
stoic calmness give way, and that was when she
said of the Purgatory she anticipated, "And there
I shall see Philip!"  And Celia felt that nearly all
she could do was to pray earnestly that this
wandering sheep might see Philip elsewhere.  Then
they took leave of Claude Ingram, and she went
back to the convent chapel, and tried to make a
little more of her salvation by kneeling on the
cold stones and repeating interminable Litanies
and Ave Marias.  So we leave her to her hard
task&mdash;hardest of tasks in all the world&mdash;to stand
before God without a Mediator, to propitiate the
Judge by the works of the law.  For "without
shedding of blood is no remission."[<a id="chap13fn13text"></a><a href="#chap13fn13">13</a>]
</p>

<p>
The summer evening is drawing to a close, as
outside the convent Harry and Celia pause to
watch the sunset.
</p>

<p>
"How beautiful God has made this world!"
says one of the travellers.  "How much more
beautiful it must be in that other land very far off,[<a id="chap13fn14text"></a><a href="#chap13fn14">14</a>]
the Heavenly Jerusalem, where is no need of the
sun,[<a id="chap13fn15text"></a><a href="#chap13fn15">15</a>] for the Lord is their everlasting light."[<a id="chap13fn16text"></a><a href="#chap13fn16">16</a>]
</p>

<p>
And the answer, associated to her with the
dead lips of Edward, comes in Celia's quietest and
softest tones&mdash;
</p>

<p>
"For 'the world passeth away, and the lust
thereof; but he that doeth the will of God abideth
forever.'"[<a id="chap13fn17text"></a><a href="#chap13fn17">17</a>]

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&#8482; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&#8482; and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Most people start at our website which has the main PG search
facility: <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org">www.gutenberg.org</a>.

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
This website includes information about Project Gutenberg&#8482;,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
